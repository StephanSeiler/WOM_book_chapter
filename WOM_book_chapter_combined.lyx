\begin_layout Standard
One of the biggest shifts in the marketing landscape in recent years has
 been a shift towards social media platforms to advertise products or have
 consumers advocate on the brand's behalf.
 Marketing spending on social media is projected to amount to 20% of marketing
 budgets by 2020 and online word-of-mouth (WOM) is considered to be one
 of the most effective forms of marketing by many marketing executive.
 At the same time, systematic empirical evidence on the effectiveness of
 paid and earned advertising is relatively scant.
 This is partly due to social media marketing being a relatively recent
 phenomenon, but partly also due to unique measurement challenges in this
 area which we outline in detail below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this article we focus on online WOM (rather than advertising run directly
 by firms) and outline the current state of the academic literature on this
 topic.
 We first outline measurement challenges in the realm of WOM and how they
 can be resolved.
 We then summarize recent findings on the effectiveness of WOM in two domains:
 customer reviews and online conversations about brands on platforms like
 twitter or other social media.
 The former are a type of activity that typically occurs after consumption
 and that imposes a specific structure (often a rating scale) on consumers'
 WOM.
 The latter instead 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511971860
are
\change_unchanged
 less structured and can take place before or after consumption.
 These two areas are hence sufficiently different to treat them separately.
 Finally, we turn from the analysis of whether WOM is effective to the question
 of why it is effective.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand the measurement challenges and possible solutions
 when estimating the impact of WOM, it is instructive to draw parallels
 to the measurement of advertising effectiveness.
 The approaches to estimation in both realms share some common features,
 but also diverge in important ways which we outline below.
 As an illustration for the general measurement framework we consider the
 case of a firm offering multiple products that are characterized by different
 advertising and WOM intensity.
 The firm has historic data on marketing, i.e.
 WOM and advertising, and demand (e.g.
 quantity sold, click-through rates, conversions) at the product-level and
 wishes to understand the impact of advertising and WOM on demand.
 The general logic of our arguments below easily extends to situations where
 data 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511978964
is
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511978964
are
\change_unchanged
 available at the consumer rather than the product level.

\begin_layout Subsection
Measurement challenges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Cross-sectional inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple approach for measurement using a standard linear regression framework
 would be to regress some measure of demand on each type of marketing activity
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{j}=\alpha+\beta\times Marketing_{j}+\varepsilon_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where the index 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 refers to a product.
 One would then run a separate regression using either advertising or word-of-mo
uth as the explanatory marketing variable.
 This regression effectively compares products with high and low advertising
 / WOM and ask whether demand increases or decreases as a function of marketing.
 In order for the effect of marketing on demand, captured by the coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, to be interpreted as a 
\shape italic
causal
\shape default
 effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $Marketing_{j}$
\end_inset

 needs to be uncorrelated with the regression error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, any factor that might influence demand, such as the quality of the
 product, has to be uncorrelated with advertising / WOM.
 Random assignment of marketing in an A/B-test setting does assure that
 there is no correlation.
 Here we contemplate the situation of historic data on demand and marketing
 activity where marketing activity is not necessarily randomly assigned.
 In fact, the very purpose of marketing departments would generally be to
 systematically allocate marketing dollars differentially across products.
 We discuss in turn advertising and WOM below.
 In each case we need to assess which underlying factors lead to a given
 level of the relevant activity in the historic data used in the regression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to advertising, we need to ask ourselves whether marketing
 activity is correlated with any factors that also affect demand directly
 (and that are therefore captured in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 A likely scenario in many setting
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511979193
s
\change_unchanged
 is the case where popular products that sold well in the past are advertised
 more heavily.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product popularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is correlated with advertising intensity and also influences demand.
 Or put differently, products with high advertising levels would have enjoyed
 high demand even in the absence of advertising due to their inherent popularity.
 Such a correlation will lead to an overestimation of the impact of advertising
 on demand.
 As we show in more detail below, it does indeed seem to be the case that
 an upward bias typically occurs in studies of advertising impact.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One salient exception where the bias can go in opposite direction is so-called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

activity bias

 in studies of online advertising (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of WOM
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511979824
,
\change_unchanged
 a similar type of bias can occur for slightly different reasons.
 Contrary to advertising, WOM is not directly under the firm's control
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511979865
,
\change_unchanged
 and hence we need to ask whether any product characteristics that lead
 consumers to talk about the product might also have a direct effect on
 demand.
 Here a scenario of reverse causality seems likely, i.e.
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511979898
,
\change_unchanged
 high demand products that a lot of consumers buy will likely also be talked
 about by a lot of consumers.
 This relationship does indeed seem fairly mechanical.
 While consumer might talk about products even without buying them, it seems
 likely 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511979944
to
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511979944
that
\change_unchanged
 a higher number of purchases will lead to a larger number of people that
 can potentially talk about the product online.
 Note that there is some parallel to the mechanism that caused upward bias
 in the relationship of advertising and demand.
 Inherently more attractive and popular products tend to be advertised more
 heavily and garner more WOM.
 Hence, a simple cross-sectional analysis of WOM is likely to also overstate
 its effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Inference with panel data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach that deals with some of the problems outlined above
 is one that relies on panel data with fixed effects at the level of the
 cross-sectional unit.
 Such an analysis requires data on demand and marketing for various products
 over time, which is often available to firms.
 The fixed effect regression takes the following form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{jt}=\xi_{j}+\gamma\times Marketing_{jt}+\nu_{jt}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

 denotes the fixed effect for product 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset


\change_inserted 2105412453 1511980076
 that stays invariant over time
\change_unchanged
.
 Note also that demand and marketing are now indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $(jt)$
\end_inset

 to indicate that we have product/time-period specific data on those variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the cross-sectional approach, we are now relating changes
 in marketing over time to changes in demand.
 I.e.
 we are asking whether in time-periods with relatively higher marketing
 intensity (for a given product) demand for that product increases.
 Importantly, any product characteristics that do not change over time do
 not pose a problem when using this approach because we control for the
 influence of such factors through product fixed effects
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511980142
 (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

)
\change_unchanged
.
 For instance products that are more popular might have higher 
\shape italic
levels
\shape default
 of marketing and demand, but this is unproblematic because the regression
 is relating changes over time in both 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511980268
variables
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511980271
marketing and demand
\change_unchanged
 to each other
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511980338
, while controling the time-invariant popularity levels through the fixed
 effects
\change_unchanged
.
 Hence in terms of threat to a causal interpretation of the impact of marketing,
 we need to consider whether there are 
\shape italic
time-varying
\shape default
 factors that correlate with marketing and also have a direct effect on
 demand.
 In the case of advertising we are cautiously optimistic that the approach
 above will recover the correct causal estimate.
 It is however much less likely to be an approach that can be applied to
 measuring WOM effectiveness.

\change_unchanged
ith regards to advertising we need to ask whether time periods in which
 advertising levels are higher are systematically different from other time
 periods in terms of demand.
 Whether this is the case again depends on the process by which advertising
 is set and that causes it to vary over time.
 In many markets there exists relatively high frequency variation in advertising
 such as for instance in consumer packages goods where supermarkets advertise
 different products through feature advertising leaflets in different weeks.
 In this market, advertising is often

\change_deleted 2105412453 1511980924
and
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511980928
Consequently,
\change_unchanged
 the specific weeks in which advertising is run are not chosen in 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511980942
a 
\change_unchanged
particularly strategic way

).
 Hence in such cases the panel approach is likely to yield a causal estimate.
 Some empirical evidence also points in the direction that fixed effects
 regressions work well in this context.

\end_inset

 find that in the case of political advertising controlling for (market-level)
 fixed effects leads to a substantial reduction in effect size whereas further
 controls change effect magnitude to a lesser degree.
 Of course, the validity of such an approach needs to be assessed on a case-by-c
ase basis.
 An example of a situation where the approach is not valid would be the
 heavy advertising of turkey around thanksgiving.
 In this time period sales of turkey would be higher even in the absence
 of advertising and hence attributing the demand increase to the concurrent
 advertising increase likely incorrect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to WOM, we think that the panel approach is less likely to work
 in this setting.
 This is due to an extension of the argument made in the cross-sectional
 case above.
 If demand increases for a given product over time, it is likely that WOM
 intensity increases as a result of the higher demand.
 For instance, consider a setting where we analyze data from a TV show over
 time and find that when viewership of the 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511981712
show 
\change_unchanged
increased, WOM also tended to be higher.
 It is very likely that higher viewership was causing higher WOM levels
 rather than the other way around.
 In the case of advertising such changes over time could also happen, for
 instance a firm might shift advertising dollars to products that experience
 sales increases.
 However this relationship is likely to be less direct than in the case
 of WOM.
 With regard to WOM
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511981773
, it
\change_unchanged
 is hard to imagine situations where demand changes without affecting WOM.
 Hence relative the the case of advertising, the panel approach is much
 less promising in the case of WOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Absolute bias and differential bias across marketing channels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we argued above, simple cross-sectional measurement of advertising and
 WOM effectiveness is likely to suffer from an upward bias, i.e.
 both types of marketing will tend to be more effective than they actually
 are.
 There is some evidence in the existing literature that such bias does indeed
 incur.
 With regards to advertising the first piece of evidence comes from comparing
 estimates of advertising effectiveness between correlational studies and
 studies with a careful causal design.
 The small set of papers in the latter category (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "super_bowl_ads"

\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "shapiro_drug_ads"

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "tuchman_2016"

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These papers all study TV advertising.
 There is also a large literature on online advertising that provides causal
 estimates of advertising impact from A/B tests.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 tend to find effects that are much smaller than correlational estimates.
 Causal advertising elasticities in such studies are estimated to be around
 0.03, i.e.
 doubling advertising increases sales by 3 percent, whereas correlational
 estimates are on average equal to 0.12 (see the meta-analysis in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sethuraman_et_al2011"

\end_inset

).
 Second, a small number of studies show the change in estimates when moving
 from simple correlations to causal research designs.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511984928

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 documents that cross-sectional advertising elasticities are equal to about
 0.07, but drop to 0.02 when switching to a fixed effect approach.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511985250
have a similar finding.
 The elasticity estimates of advertising with a better control of fixed
 effects are around 0.03, but the level is tripled when some fixed effects
 are dropped

The set of papers on WOM is much smaller, especially with regards to causal
 research designs, however tentative evidence pointing to an upward bias
 also exists.

sis of mostly correlational studies in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "you_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

 find an average elasticity of 0.2.
 Several individual studies in the realm of WOM find even much higher elasticiti
es.
 For instance,

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Liu_2006"

\end_inset

 estimate WOM elasticities between 0.59 and 1.04 across a variety of markets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important point with regards to the decision 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511985331
of 
\change_unchanged
how to allocate dollars across different marketing channels is the fact
 that while both advertising and WOM elasticity are biased upwards, the
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511985348
y
\change_unchanged
 magnitude of the bias is not identical.
 Existing evidence suggests that the upward bias is larger in the case of
 WOM and hence one might incorrectly conclude the WOM is more effective
 than advertising.
 Specifically, WOM compares favorably with advertising when considering
 correlational studies with 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511985391
an 
\change_unchanged

 of 0.12 and 0.2 for advertising and WOM respectively.
 The relative effectiveness however flips when we focus on causal estimates
 which yield an elasticities of 0.03 and 0.016 for advertising and WOM.
 It is however important to point out that there are few causal studies
 and hence our statement with regards to relative effectiveness should be
 taken with caution at this point.

 A/B test involve randomly allocating different amounts of advertising to
 different products or groups of consumers.
 For example, in the context of social media advertising, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gong_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

 randomly sent tweets about TV shows from the company's official account.
 The authors of the study randomly sent tweets for a subset of TV show and
 then compared viewership of these shows with the viewership number of shows
 that were not tweeted about (the control group).
 Such an approach circumvents the concerns raised above in the context of
 cross-sectional and panel regressions.
 If tweets (or any other type of marketing activity) is randomly assigned,
 it is by construction not correlated with the error regression error and
 a simple regression of the relevant outcome measure can be used to recover
 the causal impact.
 In this example the relevant regression would be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Viewership_{j}=\alpha+\beta\times Treatment_{j}+\varepsilon_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Treatment_{j}$
\end_inset

 is equal to one if a tweet was sent out regarding show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 was in the treatment group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to see that this research paradigm can not be easily exported
 to study WOM or more generally, the impact of any type of activity that
 is not under the firm's control.
 Running an A/B-test requires direct control of the variable of interests,
 e.g.
 the company's tweets in the example above, in order to implement a random
 assignment of that variable.
 In the case of WOM however, firms will generally not have the ability to
 randomly generate or eliminate WOM for some subset of products.
 This leads to one of the most effective and simple tools of causal measurement
 not being available in the case of measuring WOM effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that there could be situations where an experimental manipulation
 of WOM is feasible, but the scope for such manipulations is likely to be
 limited.
 For instance, in principle one could imagine that a social media platform
 could decide not to show tweets pertaining to a randomly selected group
 of products.
 A firm that was interested in studying the impact of WOM and was able to
 convince the platform to co-operate in the experiment could achieve an
 experimental manipulation of WOM due to randomly elimination of tweets
 across products.
 Our sense is that platforms will be unlikely to cooperate in such experiments
 as there might be backlash from users whose tweets do not appear due to
 the A/B test.
 A further option would be randomly generate rather than eliminate WOM by
 generating tweets from fake accounts or incentivizing users to tweets on
 the firm's behalf.
 Such activity is however likely to be something the platform would oppose
 and could potentially also violate the FTC's truth-in-advertising standard
 as paid tweets would have to be disclosed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Correctly measuring causal effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argued in the previous section, that WOM effectiveness is difficult to
 measure reliably and methods that can be applied to studies of advertising
 impact are either not available (in the case of A/B tests) or unlikely
 to work (in the case of fixed effects regressions).
 Having clearly outlined the obstacles to correct measurement, we now turn
 to a more positive outlook on methods that can be used to estimate causal
 WOM effects.

To fix ideas, we first discuss a concrete example taken from

 This paper studies the impact of user-generated microblogging activity
 on 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511986710
viewership or 
\change_unchanged
demand for TV shows in China.
 The authors have data on the daily number of tweets pertaining to each
 show as well as viewership numbers for different episodes of the same show.
 Importantly, during the time period covered by their data, the primary
 Chinese microblogging platform, Sina Weibo, was temporarily shut-down due
 to political events.
 The paper harnesses this shock and isolates the variation in microblogging
 activity that is driven by the shut-down in order to isolate the impact
 of the WOM on demand.
 In more formal terms, the authors implement an instrumental variable (IV)
 approach in a panel fixed effect regression framework (similar to the framework
 outlined above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{jt}=\xi_{j}+\gamma\times WOM{}_{jt}+\nu_{jt}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Demand_{jt}$
\end_inset

 denotes demand for the episode of show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that aired on day 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $WOM_{jt}$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of tweets pertaining to the show on day 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Crucially, the WOM measure in the regression is instrumented with a dummy
 variable that is equal to one if the specific episode aired during the
 shut-down.
 In technical terms, the instruments allows us to estimate the causal impact
 of WOM (
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511987962
 
\change_unchanged
in the regression above) even if WOM is correlated with the regression error
 term.
 The sufficient conditions for this method to work is that the instrument
 is not correlated with the regression and hence only affect demand via
 its impact on WOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, any event on the platform of interest that affected WOM, but
 that was not directly related to demand would qualify as an instrument.
 Another example for such an event is the merger of two review platforms
 which

 led to a sudden increase in the number of reviews (because the platforms
 combined the reviews that were formerly on each platform separately).
 Similar to the shut-down described above, the merger constituted an exogenous
 shift in WOM.

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, these type of events are likely to be relatively rare which
 limits the scope for this approach.
 Furthermore, exploiting events of this kind requires a less mechanical
 approach because one cannot simply apply a standardized method to any given
 set of data.
 Instead, exploiting such events requires the analyst to find suitable events
 that provide the desired variation.
 Such natural experiments therefore can only provide specific case studies.
 This is in contrast to A/B tests or simpler methods such as fixed effect
 regression which can be implemented repeatedly by firms and provide a standardi
zed and continuous analytical toolkit.
 On the positive side, specific events such as the shut-down or the platform
 merger are often broad in scope and hence can be leveraged to analyze many
 different product markets that were affected by these events due their
 presence on the platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A/B tests as Instruments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method that is related to the one just outlined, but more readily available
 is an indirect manipulation of WOM.
 The key idea is to use information on any activity that a firm might be
 using to foster WOM among its users.
 For instance, it could be the case that firms is running a targeted advertising
 campaigns to users that provided positive WOM in the past.
 In a setting where the firms sells different products, it could randomly
 assign products to such a targeted advertising campaigns.
 Hence, for some randomly selected set of products, active users are targeted
 with advertising and start generating additional WOM.
 Relative to a standard A/B test the random assignment has been applied
 not directly to the variable of interest, but to an activity (targeted
 advertising in this case) that is under the firm's control and correlated
 with the variable of interest.
 This approach allows us to combine some of the strengths of A/B tests with
 the natural experiment framework.
 Namely, we can now regress demand on WOM and use the randomly assigned
 variable as an instrument for WOM.
 As before, we are thus isolating the variation in WOM that is due to the
 randomly assigned variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an approach has the advantage that it is scale-able.
 Contrary to natural experiments, we are not constraint to leverage existing
 variation that might occur infrequently, but can instead generate useful
 (i.e.
 random) variation ourselves.
 At the same time, by applying the A/B test mechanics indirectly, we circumvent
 the issue that WOM is not directly under the firm's control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main downside of this approach is that it might be hard to find intervention
s that affect WOM without also directly affecting demand.
 In our example above, it is likely that the targeted advertising campaign
 not only affect the amount of WOM but also make the users receiving advertising
 more likely to buy the product.
 Hence the instrument will be 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511991312
impact
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511991314
affecting
\change_unchanged
 demand directly and not only via its impact on WOM.
 In this particular case, the problem could be solved if one can track the
 sales of users that were targeted with advertising and only study the impact
 of WOM on demand of users that did not receive any advertising.

Regression Discontinuity Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511994576
Regression discontinuity (RD) is another more readily available approach
 for firms to study the effect of online WOM on demand, in particular online
 reviews.
 This approach explores the discontinuity of some measures of WOM, or the
 discontinuity of some marketing measures that affect WOM.
 The cause of such discontinuity, however, are arguably uncorrelated with
 the variation of demand, hence providing convincing identification for
 the causal inference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511994838
To facilitate an easier exposition, consider a classical example of online
 WOM, Yelp reviews of restaurants.
 As discussed above, directly regressing demand on the average ratings may
 not result in reliable causal inference.
 In this case, we may take advantage of an artificial fact of how Yelp presents
 the ratings to its users.
 The most common way of presenting these reviews to consumers is the average
 rating of a restaurant, which is a unweighted simple average across all
 ratings provided by consumers pertaining to the restaurant.
 When computing the average rating, Yelp (and many other platforms) rounds
 the result to the nearest half star (e.g., 4.0 or 4.5).
 Such a rounding method creates the discontinuity that is uncorrelated with
 demand.
 For example, a restaurant with an average rating of 4.24 and another one
 of 4.25 will be presented as rating 4.0 and 4.5, respectively.
 These two restaurants are arguably having similar quality due to the closeness
 of their actual average ratings (4.24 vs.
 4.25).
 The artificial and much larger difference of 0.5 in ratings due to the rounding,
 however, may lead to variations in demand, which can be attributed to online
 WOM.

 that would be nice.

** c) Can we say anything about the extent of bias in the estimates.

Academic interest in consumer reviews goes nearly as far back as the appearance
 of the first online reputation systems on e-commerce platforms like eBay
 and Amazon.
 Reviews – the information units of reputation systems – typically consist
 of a numeric score (typically represented as a rating between 1 and 5 stars),
 the review submission date, and some open-ended text that allows consumers
 to evaluate a business (or a product) in their own words.
 Some reputation systems allow consumers to attach pictures to their reviews,
 and to separately rate businesses on dimensions such as service and price.
 Another commonly implemented feature lets consumers rate others' reviews
 as

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Reputation systems also display certain basic facts about reviewers such
 as their review history, a profile picture, and location, though they do
 not require that reviewers disclose their true identity.
 Most reputation systems allow anyone to submit to review, which has raised
 concerns about review fraud (

 Various strategies are in place to mitigate this concern including publishing
 reviews only by consumers whose purchases can be verified, highlighting
 reviews that can be linked to verified purchases using special badges,
 and relying on fraud-detection algorithms to discard fake reviews.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An average rating is simply the

 mean of all individual ratings a business or product has received, often
 rounded to the nearest decimal point of half-star.

 Average ratings, which are meant to capture overall quality, are prominently
 displayed and used to rank products and businesses in response to user
 queries.
 For instance, the query

 causal impact on demand and pricing, though the magnitude of this effects

 The findings of these papers, which rely on different methods and study
 different eBay product categories are broadly consistent: highly-rated
 sellers attract more bidders in their auctions, fetch higher prices, and
 sell their items with higher probability.
 Interestingly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

Similar effects for review valence have been demonstrated on other review
 and e-commerce platforms.
 For example,

 find that the sales ranks of books on Amazon depend on their average ratings.
 Looking at Yelp

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 estimate the impact of average ratings on restaurant demand and respectively
 find that a one-star increase in ratings causes a 5% increase in revenue
 and a 50% increase in the probability of being sold out.
 To demonstrate causality, both of these studies rely on a clever regression
 discontinuity (RD) design that exploits the fact that Yelp rounds average
 ratings to the nearest half-star: a business with a 4.24 average is rounded
 down to 4 stars, while a business with a nearly identical rating of 4.25
 stars is up to 4.5 stars.

While many studies have investigated the impact of average ratings, less
 is known about other aggregate measures.
 One exception is the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sun2012variance"

\end_inset

 who studies the variance of ratings.
 Reputation systems do not explicitly display rating variances.
 However, most display histograms of reviews counts broken down by rating.
 By looking at these histograms of ratings consumers can infer their variance.
 Motivated by a theoretical model, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sun2012variance"

\end_inset

 presents empirical evidence that increased variance in ratings has a positive
 impact on the demand of low-rated products.
 The key intuition behind this result is that low-rated products with some
 high individual ratings (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, high variance) may be appealing to at least acertain subset of consumers,
 while products with consistently low ratings (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, low variance) are less likely to be appealing to anyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Review volume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another salient and well-studied feature of reputation systems is review
 volume.
 Review counts are typically displayed prominently next to average ratings,
 and consumers can also use them to infer quality.
 All else equal, we may expect that consumers will have less uncertainty
 about the quality of products with more reviews.
 Therefore, increases in review volume could lead to increased demand.
 While the hypothesis that changes in review volume affect demand is plausible,
 testing it raises a complex identification challenge: while more reviews
 may cause sales, the reverse is also true, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, increased sales can result in more reviews.
 Finding instruments or plausibly exogenous variation in review volume has
 proven to be difficult.
 Therefore, to resolve this reserve causality issue, researchers have primarily
 relied on experimental methods.

 topics to vary from sentence to sentence as opposed to the common practice

 The sentence topic model is found to fit the data better than standard
 topic models and to produce more meaningful topics.

The second approach is grounded in consumer behavior theory and starts by
 forming a hypothesis regarding the effects of specific text constructs.
 These constructs are typically detected manually (
\emph on
e.g.
\emph default
, using human coders), or with simple pattern matching rules.
 Sometimes, researchers combine this technique with machine learning: after
 manually labeling a small set of reviews, a classifier is trained to predict
 the presence of specific text constucts in larger unlabelled review corpora.
 An advantage of using theory to form hypotheses is that one can design
 experiments to test these hypotheses leading to internally valid estimates.

Both approaches for studying text are valuable.
 Statistical approaches can uncover patterns in text whose importance might
 not be evident a priori.
 At the same time, statistical approaches offer no direct connection to
 theory, and linking patterns uncovered by statistical methods to theoretical
 constructs can be difficult.
 Consumer behavior theory can help resolve these problems by guiding our
 search in the high-dimensional space of language patterns, and informing
 the design of experiments to estimate causal treatment effects.

 Are there other relevant dimensions? Do we have multiple studies backing

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the findings in the literature point towards substantial causal
 effects on the impact of ratings, review volume, and review text on demand.
 In addition to studying these features directly, a number of papers have
 examined various moderators of the relationship between reviews and demand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consistent theme that has emerged in the literature is that the relationship
 between ratings and demand (or prices) depends on consumers' prior quality
 uncertainty.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Luca_2016"

\end_inset

 finds that that Yelp ratings do impact the revenue of chain restaurants
 because there exists little a priori uncertainty about their quality.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 find that the impact of TripAdvisor ratings is much smaller for chain-affiliate
d hotels than it is for independently operated properties.
 Also looking at the hotel industry, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hollenbeck2016online"

\end_inset

 investigates the evolution of the relationship between brand value and
 demand and finds that between 2000 and 2015 the impact of branding on revenue
 declined by 50% due increased adoption of consumer reviews.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer awareness is another important moderator of the impact of ratings
 on demand.
 In a fascinating study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger2010positive"

\end_inset

 show that even negative reviews can have a positive impact on sales when
 they cause a sufficient increase in awareness.
 By contrast, negative reviews for well-known products decrease sales, as
 expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The provenance of reviews also affects their impact on demand.
 For instance, an emerging feature of reputation systems is the ability
 to read and write reviews via mobile applications.
 Review platforms typically indicate whether a review was written using
 a mobile app or a desktop site.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "grewal2016mobile"

\end_inset

 compare reviews submitted via mobile applications to reviews submitted
 using a desktop a website.
 Using a combination of TripAdvisor data, and lab experiments they show
 that mobile reviews are more persuasive, and thus have a larger impact
 on demand, than desktop reviews.
 The mechanism underlying this effect is that when consumers believe that
 reviewers who use a mobile app have to put in an extra effort in composing
 reviews (e.g., due to the physical limitations of small phone screens), and
 thus their reviews are more trustworthy than review submitted via a traditional
 desktop website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand depends on the timing of reviews with respect to the product life-cycle.
 Relying on meta-analysis, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "babic2016effect"

\end_inset

 find that early reviews are more important in driving the sales for new
 products than they are for new services because service quality can vary
 greatly over time whereas product quality remains relatively fixed.
 Thus recent reviews are far more important for services whereas initial
 reviews are more important for products.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it worth mentioning that the effects we have discussed above are
 unlikely to represent long-term equilibrium outcomes.
 As consumers pay more attention to the increasing number of reviews accumulatin
g online, the influence of these reviews on demand and pricing will also
 likely become stronger.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 provide some evidence for the evolution of these treatment effect by looking
 at hotel demand as a function of TripAdvisor ratings over a decade.
 The study finds that the impact of a 1-star increase in a hotel's average
 rating went for zero to 25% between 2004 and 2014.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1) move some of the content on identification strategy into section 2.3 above.
 What seems to fit here is our natural experiment and the influential re-tweet
 condition from Gong et al.
 The latter might actually be illegal in the US if the side payment is not
 declared (against truth in advertising standards), so it might be worth
 highlighting that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2) Section on impact / effect magnitude (this is already the case)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** a) within this section distinguish volume and text (it might also be
 worth drawing a parallel to reviews where we have valence/volume/text,
 here valence does not exists due to the nature of conversations; this is
 an important difference)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** b) it might be nice to also discuss why there is less research on this
 topic relative to reviews (data availability etc.?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

ative sentiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** d) My take is that the Gong et al.
 and Petrova et al.
 studies really do not fit very well with the overall theme because they
 are not about WOM but firms' own tweets.
 I would drop that content.
 The one thing to retain might be the influential re-tweet aspect of Gong

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998773
 SY: I dropped Petrova et al.
 and keep Gong et al.'s discussion on retweets.

 The effect is large but it is not an elasticity.
 I note it in the writing.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** e) Is there really nothing else on conversations that is even close to

 They do not have WOM data, but essentially think of the demand dynamics
 they find as driven by WOM.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998786
 I can only think Moretti (2011) fits.
 Several other papers, e.g., Knight and Schiff (2010), Cabral and Natividad

 happen.

 to marketing is in the form of online conversations among

 online social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook to communicate
 and discuss a common topic related to the firm, such as its brand or product.
 As discussed earlier, we decide that these two types of WOM should be evaluated
 separately.
 One key difference between reviews and online conversations is that conversatio
ns by definition have an interactive and social component, and can happen
 both after and before the consumption.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511997949
 A second unique feature of conversations is that the consumption decision
 may not only depend on the customer's exposure to the conversations prior
 to the consumption, but also her expectation about her participation into
 the conversations after the consumption.
 Furthermore, while online conversations also have the characteristics of
 volume and sentiment expressed in the text as reviews do, they do not have
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valence
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by nature, which is a third key difference between the two types of online
 WOM.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conversations among customers used to be confined within offline small social
 circles.
 Such conversations, however, have become more prevalently online with the
 ascendency of social media platforms.
 For a more focused discussion below, we are especially interested in the
 effectiveness of online interactions on social media platforms such as
 Twitter and Facebook.
 We also consider tweeting, retweeting, forwarding, commenting, and other
 activities on these platforms all fit into the loosely defined 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

online conversations.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To answer the question about how effective online conversations are, it
 would be useful to first consider how we can measure the effectiveness
 of online conversations.
 In both practice and academia, many focus on measuring the volume of online
 conversations in the context of social media (e.g., the number of posts and
 comments about a firm and its products on Twitter or Facebook).
 However, in our opinion, the most straightforward and objective metric
 is the incremental demand or sales caused by online conversations.
 Especially, the mere volume of online conversations is mostly an intermediary
 objective, while the ultimate goal of the firm is to enhance its demand.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511997984
Furthermore, volume is only one characteristics of online conversations.
 As mentioned above, sentiment embedded in the text is another important
 feature of online conversations.
 
\change_unchanged
Below we will introduce a few recent studies that pay extra attention to
 the measurement challenges aforementioned and carefully rely on exogenous
 data variations to infer the effectiveness of online conversations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Impact on Demand

\begin_layout Standard
Can online conversations affect sales? Based on the extant research, the
 answer is a qualified yes, and the effect is potentially moderate in size.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
It is difficult to gauge the cost of managing online conversations.
 Accordingly, we choose not to assess the ROI of online conversations.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many studies proclaim high effectiveness of online conversation on boosting
 demand and leading to additional sales, and often laud it as a more effective
 marketing tool than traditional advertising.
 For example, the meta-analysis of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "you_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

 documents an astonishing average elasticity of online WOM as 0.2.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998066
In other words, if the volume of online conversations increases by 100%,
 the demand may increase up to 20%.
 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511998038
Furthermore, several studies which specifically zoom in on online conversations
 on social media websites report even higher level of elasticities (e.g.,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sonnier_et_al2011"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Dhar_Chang_2009"

\end_inset

).
 
\change_unchanged
However, empirical studies using observational data of online WOM and demand
 are often subject to the measurement challenges mentioned in Section XX,
 and tend to overestimate the effect size.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More researchers have started to pay attention to the measurement bias problem,
 though the research on the topic is still sparse because online conversations
 are not under the direct control of firms.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512014464
Consequently, it is rather difficult to gather data with convincing exogenous
 variations that are necessary for correcting estimation bias.

 An important feature of this block is that it was caused by the political

Another feature of online conversations is the sentiment expressed in the

 We note that tweets from a firm's official account may not be fully qualified
 as online conversations by customers.
 However, the retweets from (hired) influentials, and potentially additional
 comments and retweets from their followers, can be labeled as online conversati
ons, which may also play a role in enhancing demand.
 In a different context of political campaigning, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 consider the effect of a politician opening an official twitter account
 on campaign donations from supporters.
 The authors rely on the variations of timing of opening the twitter account
 and different penetration rates of twitter across markets, demonstrating
 that the official twitter account opening consequently increases donations,
 and the effect size is comparable to political advertising.
 Again, the study focuses on the

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511999205
There are at least three channels through which online conversations may
 affect consumers' decisions and consequently the overall demand.
 The three channels are, information, persuasion, and complementarity.
 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511999237
For the ease of exposition, we contruct our discussion of the mechanisms
 of online conversations on demand using the conceptual framework proposed
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bagwell_2007"

\end_inset

 for analyzing advertising's impact, which are information, persuasion,
 and complementarity between online conversations and product consumption.
 Although online conversations differ from traditional advertising, these
 three possible channels may be generalized to any kind of information provision
, also including online conversations.
 
\change_unchanged
Informative effects can arise when online conversations among customers
 generate or disseminate product/brand information that 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1511999331
resolves uncertainty about the product, enhances the awareness, 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1511999341
the customers value,
\change_unchanged
 or purely remind customers about the product.
 Persuasive effects may enhance customers' preference towards the product,
 even without delivering information.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512000434
We should note that these two channels are often intertwined and difficult
 to distinguish in practice.
 
\change_unchanged
Lastly, complementarity between online conversations and product consumption
 may happen 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512014947
when
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512014946
if

The information and persuation effects of advertising has long been established

 It is reasonable to expect online conversations may function in a similar
 fashion.

 Such quality information derived from conversations directly affects consequent

 online and offline.

The third mechanism, the complementarity between conversations and product

\change_deleted 2105412453 1512001803
 for online conversations
\change_unchanged
.
 Using TV viewership (demand) and online microblogging data, the authors
 delve into the timing of the online conversations to the airing of TV shows.
 In particular, they show that

more

conversations 
\emph on

 Intuitively, this finding implies that online conversations have functioned

 Complementarity channel, on the contrary, may affect one's decision both
 before and 
\emph on
after
\emph default
 the consumption.
 This is because both the pre-show and post-show conversations can be complement

 In particular, before the show's airing, the expectation of post-show conversat

, the authors demonstrate that both conversations with positive sentiment
 and those with negative sentiment may enhance demand.
 If information and persuasion are the main channels through which online
 conversations work, we would have expected the negative conversations reduce
 demand and positive ones enhance demand.
 Instead, when complementarity is the key channel, both types of sentiment
 may enhance demand, because they may simply be the indicator of a heated
 or even controversial debate among enthusiastic consumers.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512003243
Research on the relationship between online conversations and demand is
 still relatively sparse, in comparison to the research on online reviews.
 Most of the studies so far focus on the magnitude of the effect size and
 potential mechanisms.
 Below, we want to propose a few potential moderators of the relationship.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512016001
The first potential moderator is consumers' uncertainty about the product's
 quality or value.
 Consider a product where consumers are rather uncertain about its quality.
 Per the discussion of the mechanisms above, information is a channel through
 which online conversations affect demand.
 As a result, informative online conversations can surely reduce the uncertainty
 and play a role in shaping consumption decisions.
 Furthermore, for some products, the uncertainty regarding quality or value
 cannot be resolved even after the consumption.
 Such products are termed as credence products.
 Automobile repairs, medical procedures, and dietary supplements are good
 examples of such products.
 There are also some products, whose values/quality are fairly subjective,
 for example, a TV show or a concert.
 In this case, because the values/quality are difficult to assess, both
 before and after the consumption, we suspect the complementarity channel
 may be especially important, where part of the utility is derived from
 the conversations, where the value/quality of the product becomes less
 critical.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512016057
The second possible moderator is the trustworthiness of participants in
 the conversation.
 This is especially true if the main role of conversations is informative
 or persuasive.
 In the literature of network effect where an individual's decision depends
 on others' in her network, it is well documented that an influential consumer's
 decision may greatly impact those in her network (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

).
 We conjecture that such patterns may be applied to the current context
 as well, where the online posts by influentials can be crucial in affecting
 others' consumption.

 For instance which products are talked about more often seems less related

The sentiment of conversations may be much more difficult to control, and
 manipulating the sentiment potentially has some legal and ethical implications.
 Furthermore, when the complementarity channel is at work, even conversations
 with negative sentiment can increase demand (see Section XXX).

 For example, what types of content are more likely be shared among users
 in their conversations, and what types of individuals on social media platforms
 are more likely to share or forward content?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A number of studies have investigated how content of online conversations
 may affect the spread and hence enhance the overall volume of online conversati
ons.
 For example, through a series of studies, Berger and coauthors evaluate
 what content and products are more likely to be discussed on social network.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger2011"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger_milkman"

\end_inset

 suggest content or products that result in certain emotions (e.g., anxiety
 or amusement) are more likely to lead to more social sharing and online
 conversations.
 Such emotions are often associated with high level of awareness, alert,
 or attention of customers.
 In contrast, some other emotions, such as sadness, are less likely to lead
 to more social sharing and online conversations.
 In another study, using both field experiments and lab experiments, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger_schwartz"

\end_inset

 show that, on one hand, interesting products may generate more immediate
 conversations, but the attention may diminish soon.
 In the long run, these products receive less ongoing discussion over time.
 On the other hand, products that are more publicly visible enjoy a more
 sustainable WOM trend among customers.
 Using twitter data, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "zhang_2017"

\end_inset

 further highlight the importance of fit between message content and the
 interest of the user.
 When the content of a message fits a user's interest, which is identified
 using the user's past tweets, the message is more often rebroadcasted by
 the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another stream of research consider the question of how to identify the
 types of users who are more crucial in driving the volume of online conversatio
ns.
 For example, since the seminal work by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Katz_Lazarsfeld_1955"

\end_inset

, there are abundant studies that emphasize the importance of influential
 users' impact on others in the network (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "harikesh_2010"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "IVV_2011"

\end_inset

).
 It is intuitive to generalize the argument that on social media platforms
 influential users may affect the broadcasting decisions of others in their
 network.
 As a result, some studies that focus on identifying the influential users
 and users' susceptibility to influence from others (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

One problematic approach is to directly gauge which types or groups of customers
 have more activities on social media.
 As discussed in Section XX, such an approach can be biased and often overestima
te the roles of certain groups of customers in enhancing online conversations.
 For example, suppose a firm released a new product and subsequently observed
 there was a large uptick in online conversations originated from some certain
 geographic areas.
 It happened to be the case that, due to limited inventory, the product
 was only initially rolled out in those areas.
 It would be erroneous to draw the inference that customers in those areas
 were more crucial in driving online conversations about the product.
 To avoid such incorrect conclusions, many studies rely on exogenous variations
 in data to derive inference.

, for example, use a large scale of field experiment on Facebook to investigate
 which types of customers are more likely to influence or be influenced
 on a social network.
 They randomly choose recipients out of a representative sample of 1.3 million
 Facebook users to receive messages from their friends about a product.
 They then monitor the adoption behavior of these users as well as collect
 demographic information of these users and of those from whom they receive
 the messages.

While the exact key performance indicator (KPI) or outcome variable in this
 study is the adoption of a product instead of the increase in conversation
 volume, the product can be easily conceptualized as online conversation
 such as a tweet.
 Correspondingly, the adoption of the product is the rebroadcasting of the
 tweet.

 They find that older users are less susceptible than their younger counterparts
, women are less influential than men, but can influence men more than they
 do on other women, and married individuals are the least likely to be influence
d.
 Interestingly, influential users are less susceptible than non-influential
 users and they are more likely to cluster together in the network.
 This finding suggests that the spread of products or message in a network
 may crucially depend on influential people with influential friends.

In this study, the field experiments renders the results more convincing
 because it helps mitigating different potential biases.
 First, because of the random assignment of the treatment, it avoids confounding
 factors such as selection bias where firms or the platform specifically
 choose to target customers who previously show more interests in related
 conversations or products.
 Second, the experiments also uses identical messages which eliminate the
 heterogeneity often seen in tailored/curated content that may affect customers'

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 use field experiments on Twitter to study whether early trend propagators
 are more likely to spread words about firms and products.
 To be specific, they collaborate with two companies who post content (ads)
 on Twitter.
 Using user past activities on Twitter, they identify users who share early
 trendy topics on Twitter more often, i.e., early trend propagators.
 They randomly target the content at those early trend propagators and those
 who only embrace trends later.
 Next, they monitor the users to see who are more likely to tweet or retweet
 the content.
 While the conventional wisdom suggests that the early trend propagators
 should be more likely to disseminate the content, they do not find such
 evidence in the data.
 In fact, they find exactly the opposite where consumers who are not early
 trend propagators are more likely to tweet or retweet the content.
