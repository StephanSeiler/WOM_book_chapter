In this chapter
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603058
,
\change_unchanged
 we outline the current state of the academic literature regarding the impact
 of online WOM on demand.
 We first outline measurement challenges in the realm of WOM and how they
 can be resolved.
 We then summarize recent findings on the effectiveness of WOM in two domains:
 customer reviews and online conversations about brands on platforms 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603072
like
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603073

witter or other social media.
 The former are a type of activity that typically occur

 after consumption and that impose
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603095
s
\change_unchanged
 a specific structure (often a rating scale) on consumers' WOM.
 The latter instead are less structured and can take place before and/or
 after consumption.
 These two areas are sufficiently different to be treated separately.

 The approaches to estimation in both realms share some common features,
 but also diverge in several ways.
 Importantly, methods for measuring advertising effectiveness, which are
 fairly well developed, cannot be directly applied to measuring the impact
 of WOM.
 Hence, marketing managers need to develop new frameworks for measuring

\begin_layout Standard
As an illustration for the general measurement framework
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603221
,
\change_unchanged
 we consider the case of a firm offering multiple products that are characterize
d by different advertising and WOM intensities.
 The firm has historic data on marketing activities, 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603233
namely,
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603232
i.e.

\change_unchanged
 WOM and advertising, and demand (e.g.
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603242
.

\change_unchanged
 quantity sold, click-through rates, conversions) at the product
\change_inserted -192373176 1513618512
 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513618512
-
\change_unchanged
level and wishes to understand the impact of 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603261
WOM and 
\change_unchanged
advertising 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603264
and WOM 
\change_unchanged
on demand.
 The general logic of our arguments below easily extends to situations 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603281
where
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603282
in which
\change_unchanged
 data are available at the consumer rather than the product level.
 For the remainder of this section, we refer generically to

WOM intensity

 and do not distinguish between specific types of WOM
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603289
,
\change_unchanged
 such as the number of tweets, number of consumer reviews, 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603294
and so on
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603292

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Cross-sectional inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple approach for measurement using a standard linear regression framework
 would be to regress some measure of demand on each type of marketing activity
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603305
,
\change_unchanged
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{j}=\alpha+\beta\times Marketing_{j}+\varepsilon_{j},
\]

\end_inset

where the index 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 refers to a product.
 One would then run a separate regression using either advertising or WOM
 as the explanatory marketing variable.
 This regression effectively compares products with high and low advertising
 / WOM and ask
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603328
s
\change_unchanged
 whether demand increases or decreases as a function of the marketing activity
 of interest.
 I
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603338
n order f
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603338
F
\change_unchanged
or the effect of marketing on demand, captured by the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, to be interpreted as a 
\shape italic
causal
\shape default
 effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $Marketing_{j}$
\end_inset

 needs to be uncorrelated with the regression error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, any factor that might influence demand, such as the quality of the
 product, has to be uncorrelated with advertising / WOM.
 Random assignment of marketing in an A/B-test setting does assure 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603362
that there is 
\change_unchanged
no such correlation
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603367
 exists
\change_unchanged
.
 Here we consider the situation 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603370
where
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603371
in which
\change_unchanged
 marketing activity is not necessarily randomly assigned.
 We start with a discussion of (the more familiar case of) measuring 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603383
the 
\change_unchanged
advertising impact as a reference point
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603387
,
\change_unchanged
 and then highlight similarities and differences regarding 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603394
the 
\change_unchanged
WOM impact.
 In each case
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603424
,
\change_unchanged
 we need to assess which underlying factors lead to a given level of the
 relevant activity in the historical data used for estimation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to advertising, we need to ask ourselves whether marketing
 activity is correlated with any factors that also affect demand directly
 (and that are therefore captured in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 A likely scenario in many settings is the case 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603441
where
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603441
in which
\change_unchanged
 popular products that sold well in the past are advertised more heavily.
 Hence
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603447
,
\change_unchanged
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product popularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is correlated with advertising intensity and also influences demand.
 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603456
Or put differently
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603457
In other words
\change_unchanged
, products with high advertising levels would have enjoyed high demand even
 in the absence of advertising
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603465
,
\change_unchanged
 due to their inherent popularity.
 Such a correlation will lead to an overestimation of the impact of advertising
 on demand.
 As we show in more detail below, 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513603480
it does indeed seem to be the case that 
\change_unchanged
an upward bias typically 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513603486
does seem to 
\change_unchanged
occur

An alternative approach that deals with some of the problems outlined above

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the cross-sectional approach, we are now relating changes
 in marketing over time to changes in demand
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604695
; that is,
\change_deleted -192373176 1513604693
.
 I.e.

\change_unchanged
 we are asking whether in time

)
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604732
,
\change_unchanged
 demand for that product increases.
 Importantly, any product characteristics that do not change over time do
 not pose a problem when using this approach
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604740
,
\change_unchanged
 because we control for the influence of such factors through product fixed
 effects (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 For instance
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604745
,
\change_unchanged
 products that are more popular might have higher 
\shape italic
levels
\shape default
 of marketing and demand, but this

issue 
\change_unchanged
is unproblematic
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604756
,
\change_unchanged
 because the regression is relating changes over time in both marketing
 and demand to each other, while controlling for time-invariant popularity
 levels through the fixed effects.
 Hence
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604787
,
\change_unchanged
 in terms of threats to a causal interpretation of the impact of marketing,
 we need to consider whether 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513604794
there are
\change_inserted -192373176 1513604795

 This is due to

 an extension of the argument made in the cross-sectional case above.
 If demand increases for a given product over time,

increase

s
\change_unchanged
 as a result of the higher demand.
 For instance, consider a setting where we analyze data from a TV show over

 In the case of advertising, such changes over time could also happen.
 For instance, a firm might shift advertising dollars to products that experienc

\[

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Viewership_{jt}$

\end_inset

 denotes the number of tweets about the show on day

 To isolate exogenous variation in WOM, the WOM measure is instrumented
 with a dummy variable that is equal to 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513606405
1
\change_deleted -192373176 1513606404

 for episodes that aired during the shut

\change_unchanged
down, and zero otherwise.
 This regression recovers the causal impact of WOM on demand if the instrument
 and the error term are uncorrelated, even if WOM itself is correlated with
 the error term.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, any event that affects WOM without directly affecting demand
 qualifies as a natural experiment.
 Another example of such an event is the merger of two review platforms
 studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 Prior to the merger
\change_inserted -192373176 1513606429
,
\change_unchanged
 the two platforms were collecting reviews separately, each platform computing
 average ratings using its own database of reviews.
 The merger of the review databases led to a sudden change in average ratings.
 Similar to the shut
\change_deleted -192373176 1513607521

 to have been related to a change in demand.

\begin_layout Standard
The main difficulty in using natural experiments as a tool for causal inference
 is identifying such experiments
\change_deleted -192373176 1513607536
 in the first place
\change_unchanged
.
 Events that cause exogenous changes in the status quo are rare, and pinpointing
 them often requires expert domain knowledge.
 Moreover, arguing for the suitability of different events as a natural
 experiment
\change_deleted -192373176 1513607546
s
\change_unchanged
 has to be done on a case-by-case basis.
 This 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513607558
requirement 
\change_unchanged
is in contrast to methods 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513607561
like
\change_inserted -192373176 1513607563
such as
\change_unchanged
 A/B testing and fixed-effects regressions, which can be readily implemented
 by firms to provide a standardized analytical toolkit.
 Despite this limitation, because natural experiments are usually broad
 in scope, once identified, they can be leveraged to analyze different product
 markets and outcomes of interest.
 For example, both the shut
\change_deleted -192373176 1513607577
-
\change_unchanged
down and the merger described above constitute platform-wide shocks that
 can 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513607583
be
\change_deleted -192373176 1513607582
the
\change_unchanged
 used to study WOM effects for any set of products represented on the respective
 platform.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second limitation of natural experiments is that they often yield context-spec
ific estimates.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 can estimate the causal impact of ratings in July 2013, the date of the
 review platform merger.
 This natural experiment cannot provide insight as to the magnitude of the
 treatment effect at other points in time.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final concern with natural experiments, especially those causing large
 changes to the status quo, is that firms or individuals may anticipate
 them and strategically adjust their behavior.
 In this case, comparisons of outcomes shortly before and shortly after
 the natural experiment can result in biased estimates.
 Thus, natural experiments are more convincing when evidence can be furnished
 that they were unpredictable.
 An indicative piece of evidence is the absence of pre-treatment trends.
 To the extent that natural experiments are unpredictable, patterns of the
 outcome variable just before the natural experiment should look similar
 to historical patterns.
 Unexplained systematic variation prior to the natural experiment may suggest
 the natural experiment is invalid.

A method that is related to the one just outlined, but more readily available
\change_inserted -192373176 1513609089
,
\change_unchanged
 is an indirect manipulation of WOM.
 The key idea is to use information on any activity 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513609129
that 
\change_unchanged
a firm might be using to foster WOM among its users.
 For instance, 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513609139
it could be the case that 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513609146

\change_unchanged
 running a targeted advertising campaign
\change_deleted -192373176 1513609181
s
\change_unchanged
 to users that provided positive WOM in the past.
 In a setting where the firm
\change_deleted -192373176 1513609194
s
\change_unchanged
 sells different products, it could randomly assign products to such a targeted
 advertising campaigns.
 Hence, for some randomly selected set of products, active users are targeted
 with advertising and start generating additional WOM.
 Relative to a standard A/B test
\change_inserted -192373176 1513609209
,
\change_unchanged
 the random assignment has been applied not 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513609222
directly 
\change_unchanged
to the variable of interest
\change_inserted -192373176 1513609227

 firm's control and correlated with the variable of interest.

 They then study the impact of the altered feedback behavior of the affected
 users on the behavior of their peers.
 Although this study does not measure the impact of WOM on demand but rather
 on user behavior within Facebook, the general framework is identical to
 the one described above.
 In this case, the assignment to an interface that makes feedback more likely
 serves as an instrument for the actual feedback behavior.

 Furthermore, we circumvent the issue

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main downside of this approach is that it might be hard to find intervention
s that affect WOM without also directly affecting demand.
 In our first example above, 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513610604
it is likely that 
\change_unchanged
the targeted advertising campaign 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610624

\change_unchanged
not only affect
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610617

\change_unchanged
 but also make
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610630

 Hence
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610649
,
\change_unchanged
 the instrument will affect demand directly and not only via its impact
 on WOM.
 In this particular case, the problem could be solved if one can track the
 sales of users

who
\change_deleted -192373176 1513610690

Regression Discontinuity

\begin_layout Standard
A final approach that can be useful to measure the impact of a specific
 type of WOM is a regression discontinuity (RD) approach.
 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513610676
While
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610678
Although
\change_unchanged
 this approach is more narrow in its application, it does provide a broadly
 applicable approach to measuring the impact of review valence, 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610711
that is,
\change_deleted -192373176 1513610710
i.e.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach is most easily explained by focusing on the particular application
 to review valence.
 A common way of presenting the average rating score of a particular product
 to users is through a star rating that is rounded to the nearest half star.
 Yelp (as well as many other platforms) present
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610964
s
\change_unchanged
 average ratings in this particular way.
 The rounding generates a discontinuous jump in the perceived rating, and
 two products with very similar underlying scores might take on different
 values on the half-star scale.
 For instance
\change_inserted -192373176 1513610980
,
\change_unchanged
 two products with average ratings of 4.24 and 4.26 will be presented as 4

 We can compare such products

 believe

 that

 products with higher star ratings are systematically different along other
 dimensions that correlate with demand.

 except for their star ratings.
 Hence
\change_inserted -192373176 1513611038

\change_unchanged
 the causal impact of the star ratings can be obtained by comparing demand
 for products marginally above and marginally below the rounding threshold.

the RD design 
\change_inserted -192373176 1513611186
is

 Importantly, any firm that sells multiple products through a platform that
 uses rounded rating scores can find the subset of products in their assortment
 that have ratings close to the rounding cut

 are more important than recent reviews in driving the sales of new products.
 Because product quality remains relatively fixed, early reviews can resolve
 quality uncertainty, and subsequent reviews provide little additional informati

 A notable exception are services, whose quality can vary significantly
 over time

 For instance, compared to not being reviewed at all, a negative book review

The literature on consumer reviews is large and continues to grow.
 In this chapter, we have reviewed studies whose focus is on measuring the
 causal impact of reviews on demand and pricing.
 Overall, the evidence presented in these studies points towards reviews
 having substantial econonical effects, though the magnitudes of these effects
 varies depending on context.
 Beyond measuring the impact of reviews on demand, a lot of work has also
 been devoted to answering a variety of other interesting research question
 related to consumer reviews such as investigating the motivations of consumers
 to write reviews

SS: my take on how to organize this paragraph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1) move some of the content on identification strategy into section 2.3 above.
 What seems to fit here is our natural experiment and the influential re-tweet
 condition from Gong et al.
 The latter might actually be illegal in the US if the side payment is not
 declared (against truth in advertising standards), so it might be worth
 highlighting that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2) Section on impact / effect magnitude (this is already the case)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** a) within this section distinguish volume and text (it might also be
 worth drawing a parallel to reviews where we have valence/volume/text,
 here valence does not exists due to the nature of conversations; this is
 an important difference)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** b) it might be nice to also discuss why there is less research on this
 topic relative to reviews (data availability etc.?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** c) With regards to text we can talk about our findings regarding positive/neg
ative sentiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** d) My take is that the Gong et al.
 and Petrova et al.
 studies really do not fit very well with the overall theme because they
 are not about WOM but firms' own tweets.
 I would drop that content.
 The one thing to retain might be the influential re-tweet aspect of Gong
 et al.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998773
 SY: I dropped Petrova et al.
 and keep Gong et al.'s discussion on retweets.
 I don't think they actually calibrate elasticities.
 The effect is large but it is not an elasticity.
 I note it in the writing.
 
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** e) Is there really nothing else on conversations that is even close to
 causal? The one other set of papers that came to my mind are the movie
 ones like Gilchrist et al.
 (and there are a few others that are related).
 They do not have WOM data, but essentially think of the demand dynamics
 they find as driven by WOM.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998786
 I can only think Moretti (2011) fits.
 Several other papers, e.g., Knight and Schiff (2010), Cabral and Natividad
 (2016), and so on, mostly are about social learning where WOM don't necessarily
 happen.

We now turn to online conversations.
 This type of WOM involves consumers discussing topics on social media platforms

 following a similar structure as in the previous section on reviews.
 In particular, we discuss the impact of the volume as well as the content
 of online conversations.
 Note that

valence,

 which was discussed in the context of reviews, is not a characteristic

\change_inserted -192373176 1513615545

\change_unchanged
 due to the absence of an aggregation mechanism such as the average ratings

\change_deleted -192373176 1513615554

 Due to a political scandal, the Chinese government temporarily shut down

 Relying on this exogenous shock, the authors show 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513615587
that 
\change_unchanged
the reduction in conversation volume did lead to lower consumption of TV
 shows.
 Accordingly, a higher volume of online conversations may increase demand.
 However, the authors find that WOM only has a moderate effect in this setting.

Although

that

conversations with a higher amount of sentiment have a greater impact on
 demand.
 Interestingly, even negative conversations seem to have a positive effect
 on demand.
 One possible explanation is that negative sentiment can occur as part of
 an engaged discussion pertaining to a particular TV show.

Moderators of the impact of online conversations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To organize the discussion of moderators in the context on online conversations,
 we first present a simple conceptual framework for the possible channels
 through which conversations can influence demand.
 We consider three broad channels, namely
\change_inserted -192373176 1513615958
,
\change_unchanged
 informative effects, persuasion, and complementarity between product consumptio
n and online conversations.

 Informative effects can arise when online conversations among customers
 generate or disseminate product/brand information that resolves uncertainty
 about the product, enhances the awareness, or reminds customers about the
 product.
 Persuasive effects may enhance customers' preference toward
\change_deleted -192373176 1513615981
s
\change_unchanged
 the product without delivering information.
 Lastly, complementarity between online conversations and product consumption
 may occur when customers derive a higher utility from the product if they
 can participate in 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513615992
an 
\change_unchanged
online conversations with others who share the same interest in the product.
 We note that in the context of reviews, informative effects are likely
 to be the most relevant channel
\change_inserted -192373176 1513616001
,
\change_unchanged
 and we hence focused on effects relating to information provision and uncertain
ty when discussing moderators of reviews earlier.
 In the case of online conversations
\change_inserted -192373176 1513616011
,
\change_unchanged
 all three channels are potentially relevant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to informative effects, one potential moderator of a conversation's
 impact on demand is consumers' uncertainty about the product.
 Product uncertainty has been found to be an important moderator in the
 context of reviews and could conceivably also play a role in the case of
 conversations.

 Both the exposure to conversations prior to a purchase as well as the ability

Summary

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter, we outlined the state of the academic literature with regards
 to the impact of WOM on demand.
 Measuring impact is difficult in the context of WOM 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513616763
due to the fact
\change_inserted -192373176 1513616763
because
\change_deleted -192373176 1513616768
 that
\change_unchanged
 WOM is likely to react to changes in demand and 
\change_deleted -192373176 1513616776
because WOM 
\change_unchanged
cannot be directly manipulated by firms.
 Therefore, a set of alternative measurement methods is required.
 We described three such methods that are promising for WOM measurement:
 natural experiments, A/B tests that serve as instruments for WOM, and regressio
n discontinuity designs.
 We then reviewed the literature that analyzes the impact of WOM
\change_inserted -192373176 1513616800
,
\change_unchanged
 based on these three (as well as related) methods.

 The evidence regarding content is more preliminary and only partially causal.
