GZ: I find the following two intro paras confusing.
 They motivate the chapter by talking about spending on social media (e.g.,
 20% increased spending) but then we bait-and-switch readers and say, well
 actually, we are not going to tell you anything about advertising on social
 media (which is presumably what the spending is on) – instead we will talk
 about WOM on social media.
 I would think the right way to motivate WOM is to say WOM has increased
 (num of tweets, num of reviews, etc.) not spending.
 Further, I think we can draw a distinction between advertising on social
 media and WOM, mention a difference or two (paid vs free, consumer vs firm
 initiated) and then say we focus on WOM as opposed to paid ads.

One of the biggest shifts in the marketing landscape in recent years has
 been a shift towards social media platforms to advertise products or have
 consumers advocate on the brand's behalf.
 Marketing spending on social media is projected to amount to 20% of marketing
 budgets by 2020 and online word-of-mouth (WOM) is considered to be one
 of the most effective forms of marketing by many marketing executive.
 At the same time, systematic empirical evidence on the effectiveness of
 paid and earned advertising is relatively scant.

This is partly due to social media marketing being a relatively recent phenomeno
n, but partly also due to unique measurement challenges in this area which
 we outline in detail below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we outline the current state of the academic literature
 on online WOM (rather than advertising run directly by firms.).
 We first outline measurement challenges in the realm of WOM and how they
 can be resolved.
 We then summarize recent findings on the effectiveness of WOM in two domains:
 customer reviews and online conversations about brands on platforms like
 twitter or other social media.
 The former are a type of activity that typically occurs after consumption
 and that imposes a specific structure (often a rating scale) on consumers'
 WOM.
 The latter instead are less structured and can take place before or after
 consumption.
 These two areas are hence sufficiently different to treat them separately.
 Finally, we turn from the analysis of whether WOM is effective to the question
 of why it is effective.

SS: I wanted to make the similarities and differences clear in terms of
 inference problems, bias direction, possible fixes.
 My reason is that practitioners have a better idea of ad effectiveness
 I think and know less about WOM measurement.
 But I agree that this should not become too dominant.
 I am happy for you guys to re-write and tone that aspect down if you have
 specific ideas.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand the measurement challenges and possible solutions
 when estimating the impact of WOM, it is instructive to draw parallels
 to the measurement of advertising effectiveness.
 The approaches to estimation in both realms share some common features,
 but also diverge in important ways which we outline below.
 As an illustration for the general measurement framework we consider the
 case of a firm offering multiple products that are characterized by different
 advertising and WOM intensity.
 The firm has historic data on marketing, i.e.
 WOM and advertising, and demand (e.g.
 quantity sold, click-through rates, conversions) at the product-level and
 wishes to understand the impact of advertising and WOM on demand.
 The general logic of our arguments below easily extends to situations where
 data are available at the consumer rather than the product level.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Measurement challenges
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Cross-sectional inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple approach for measurement using a standard linear regression framework
 would be to regress some measure of demand on each type of marketing activity
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{j}=\alpha+\beta\times Marketing_{j}+\varepsilon_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where the index 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 refers to a product.
 One would then run a separate regression using either advertising or word-of-mo
uth as the explanatory marketing variable.
 This regression effectively compares products with high and low advertising
 / WOM and ask whether demand increases or decreases as a function of marketing.
 In order for the effect of marketing on demand, captured by the coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, to be interpreted as a 
\shape italic
causal
\shape default
 effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $Marketing_{j}$
\end_inset

 needs to be uncorrelated with the regression error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, any factor that might influence demand, such as the quality of the
 product, has to be uncorrelated with advertising / WOM.
 Random assignment of marketing in an A/B-test setting does assure that
 there is no correlation.
 Here we contemplate the situation of historic data on demand and marketing
 activity where marketing activity is not necessarily randomly assigned.
 In fact, the very purpose of marketing departments would generally be to
 systematically allocate marketing dollars differentially across products.
 We discuss in turn advertising and WOM below.
 In each case we need to assess which underlying factors lead to a given
 level of the relevant activity in the historic data used in the regression.

\change_unchanged
With regards to advertising, we need to ask ourselves whether marketing
 activity is correlated with any factors that also affect demand directly
 (and that are therefore captured in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 A likely scenario in many settings is the case where popular products that
 sold well in the past are advertised more heavily.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product popularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is correlated with advertising intensity and also influences demand.
 Or put differently, products with high advertising levels would have enjoyed
 high demand even in the absence of advertising due to their inherent popularity.
 Such a correlation will lead to an overestimation of the impact of advertising
 on demand.
 As we show in more detail below, it does indeed seem to be the case that
 an upward bias typically occurs in studies of advertising impact.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
One salient exception where the bias can go in opposite direction is so-called
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

activity bias
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in studies of online advertising (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lewis_Reiley_2014"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of WOM, a similar type of bias can occur for slightly different
 reasons.
 Contrary to advertising, WOM is not directly under the firm's control,
 and hence we need to ask whether any product characteristics that lead
 consumers to talk about the product might also have a direct effect on
 demand.
 Here a scenario of reverse causality seems likely, i.e., high demand products
 that a lot of consumers buy will likely also be talked about by a lot of
 consumers.
 This relationship does indeed seem fairly mechanical.
 While consumer might talk about products even without buying them, it seems
 likely that a higher number of purchases will lead to a larger number of
 people that can potentially talk about the product online.
 Note that there is some parallel to the mechanism that caused upward bias
 in the relationship of advertising and demand.
 Inherently more attractive and popular products tend to be advertised more
 heavily and garner more WOM.
 Hence, a simple cross-sectional analysis of WOM is likely to also overstate
 its effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Inference with panel data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach that deals with some of the problems outlined above
 is one that relies on panel data with fixed effects at the level of the
 cross-sectional unit.
 Such an analysis requires data on demand and marketing for various products
 over time, which is often available to firms.
 The fixed effect regression takes the following form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{jt}=\xi_{j}+\gamma\times Marketing_{jt}+\nu_{jt}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

 denotes the fixed effect for product 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that stays invariant over time.
 Note also that demand and marketing are now indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $(jt)$
\end_inset

 to indicate that we have product/time-period specific data on those variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the cross-sectional approach, we are now relating changes
 in marketing over time to changes in demand.
 I.e.
 we are asking whether in time-periods with relatively higher marketing
 intensity (for a given product) demand for that product increases.
 Importantly, any product characteristics that do not change over time do
 not pose a problem when using this approach because we control for the
 influence of such factors through product fixed effects (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 For instance products that are more popular might have higher 
\shape italic
levels
\shape default
 of marketing and demand, but this is unproblematic because the regression
 is relating changes over time in both marketing and demand to each other,
 while controling the time-invariant popularity levels through the fixed
 effects.
 Hence in terms of threat to a causal interpretation of the impact of marketing,
 we need to consider whether there are 
\shape italic
time-varying
\shape default
 factors that correlate with marketing and also have a direct effect on
 demand.
 In the case of advertising we are cautiously optimistic that the approach
 above will recover the correct causal estimate.
 It is however much less likely to be an approach that can be applied to
 measuring WOM effectiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to advertising we need to ask whether time periods in which
 advertising levels are higher are systematically different from other time
 periods in terms of demand.
 Whether this is the case again depends on the process by which advertising
 is set and that causes it to vary over time.
 In many markets there exists relatively high frequency variation in advertising
 such as for instance in consumer packages goods where supermarkets advertise
 different products through feature advertising leaflets in different weeks.
 In this market, advertising is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locked in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in advance through longer-term advertising plans between manufacturers
 and advertisers.
 Consequently, the specific weeks in which advertising is run are not chosen
 in a particularly strategic way (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rossi_2014"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_Yao_2017"

\end_inset

).
 Hence in such cases the panel approach is likely to yield a causal estimate.
 Some empirical evidence also points in the direction that fixed effects
 regressions work well in this context.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "shapiro_drug_ads"

\end_inset

 finds that estimates change little when moving from fixed effects to more
 rigorous controls.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Gordon_Hartmann_2013"

\end_inset

 find that in the case of political advertising controlling for (market-level)
 fixed effects leads to a substantial reduction in effect size whereas further
 controls change effect magnitude to a lesser degree.
 Of course, the validity of such an approach needs to be assessed on a case-by-c
ase basis.
 An example of a situation where the approach is not valid would be the
 heavy advertising of turkey around thanksgiving.
 In this time period sales of turkey would be higher even in the absence
 of advertising and hence attributing the demand increase to the concurrent
 advertising increase likely incorrect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to WOM, we think that the panel approach is less likely to work
 in this setting.
 This is due to an extension of the argument made in the cross-sectional
 case above.
 If demand increases for a given product over time, it is likely that WOM
 intensity increases as a result of the higher demand.
 For instance, consider a setting where we analyze data from a TV show over
 time and find that when viewership of the show increased, WOM also tended
 to be higher.
 It is very likely that higher viewership was causing higher WOM levels
 rather than the other way around.
 In the case of advertising such changes over time could also happen, for
 instance a firm might shift advertising dollars to products that experience
 sales increases.
 However this relationship is likely to be less direct than in the case
 of WOM.
 With regard to WOM, it is hard to imagine situations where demand changes
 without affecting WOM.
 Hence relative the the case of advertising, the panel approach is much
 less promising in the case of WOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Absolute bias and differential bias across marketing channels
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As we argued above, simple cross-sectional measurement of advertising and
 WOM effectiveness is likely to suffer from an upward bias, i.e.
 both types of marketing will tend to

be
\change_inserted -503570337 1512231377
appear
\change_unchanged
 more effective than they actually are.
 There is some evidence in the existing literature that such bias does indeed
 incur.
 With regards to advertising the first piece of evidence comes from comparing
 estimates of advertising effectiveness between correlational studies and
 studies with a careful causal design.
 The small set of papers in the latter category (e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "super_bowl_ads"

\end_inset

 , 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
These papers all study TV advertising.
 There is also a large literature on online advertising that provides causal
 estimates of advertising impact from A/B tests.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 tend to find effects that are much smaller than correlational estimates.
 Causal advertising elasticities in such studies are estimated to be around
 0.03, i.e.
 doubling advertising increases sales by 3 percent, whereas correlational
 estimates are on average equal to 0.12 (see the meta-analysis in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Sethuraman_et_al2011"

\end_inset

).
 Second, a small number of studies show the change in estimates when moving
 from simple correlations to causal research designs.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "shapiro_drug_ads"

\end_inset

 documents that cross-sectional advertising elasticities are equal to about
 0.07, but drop to 0.02 when switching to a fixed effect approach.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Gordon_Hartmann_2013"

\end_inset

 have a similar finding.
 The elasticity estimates of advertising with a better control of fixed
 effects are around 0.03, but the level is

sis of mostly correlational studies in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "you_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

 find an average elasticity of 0.2.
 Several individual studies in the realm of WOM find even much higher elasticiti
es.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sonnier_et_al2011"

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Liu_2006"

 estimate WOM elasticities between 0.59 and 1.04 across a variety of markets.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important point with regards to the decision of how to allocate dollars
 across different marketing channels is the fact that while both advertising
 and WOM elasticity are biased upwards, the magnitude of the bias is not
 identical.
 Existing evidence suggests that the upward bias is larger in the case of
 WOM and hence one might incorrectly conclude the WOM is more effective
 than advertising.
 Specifically, WOM compares favorably with advertising when considering
 correlational studies with elasticities of 0.12 and 0.2 for advertising and
 WOM respectively.
 The relative effectiveness however flips when we focus on causal estimates
 which yield an elasticities of 0.03 and 0.016 for advertising and WOM.
 It is however important to point out that there are few causal studies
 and hence our statement with regards to relative effectiveness should be
 taken with caution at this point.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A/B-test and WOM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A/B tests (also referred to as randomized field experiments) allow for clean
 causal inference and are increasingly used in many academic studies of
 advertising effectiveness (

) as well as by practitioners 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "forbes2017"

\end_inset

.
 A/B test involve randomly allocating different amounts of advertising to
 different products or groups of consumers.
 For example, in the context of social media advertising, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gong_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

 randomly sent tweets about TV shows from the company's official account.
 The authors of the study randomly sent tweets for a subset of TV show and
 then compared viewership of these shows with the viewership number of shows
 that were not tweeted about (the control group).
 Such an approach circumvents the concerns raised above in the context of
 cross-sectional and panel regressions.
 If tweets (or any other type of marketing activity) is randomly assigned,
 it is by construction not correlated with the error regression error and
 a simple regression of the relevant outcome measure can be used to recover
 the causal impact.
 In this example the relevant regression would be
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Viewership_{j}=\alpha+\beta\times Treatment_{j}+\varepsilon_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Treatment_{j}$
\end_inset

 is equal to one if a tweet was sent out regarding show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 was in the treatment group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is easy to see that this research paradigm can not be easily exported
 to study WOM or more generally, the impact of any type of activity that
 is not under the firm's control.
 Running an A/B-test requires direct control of the variable of interests,
 e.g.
 the company's tweets in the example above, in order to implement a random
 assignment of that variable.
 In the case of WOM however, firms will generally not have the ability to
 randomly generate or eliminate WOM for some subset of products.
 This leads to one of the most effective and simple tools of causal measurement
 not being available in the case of measuring WOM effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that there could be situations where an experimental manipulation
 of WOM is feasible, but the scope for such manipulations is likely to be
 limited.
 For instance, in principle one could imagine that a social media platform
 could decide not to show tweets pertaining to a randomly selected group
 of products.
 A firm that was interested in studying the impact of WOM and was able to
 convince the platform to co-operate in the experiment could achieve an
 experimental manipulation of WOM due to randomly elimination of tweets
 across products.
 Our sense is that platforms will be unlikely to cooperate in such experiments
 as there might be backlash from users whose tweets do not appear due to
 the A/B test.
 A further option would be randomly generate rather than eliminate WOM by
 generating tweets from fake accounts or incentivizing users to tweets on
 the firm's behalf.
 Such activity is however likely to be something the platform would oppose
 and could potentially also violate the FTC's truth-in-advertising standard
 as paid tweets would have to be disclosed.

SS: it seems that for reviews that are some experiments (such as generating
 a duplicate seller account with no reviews).

Correctly measuring causal effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We argued in the previous section, that WOM effectiveness is difficult to
 measure reliably and methods that can be applied to studies of advertising
 impact are either not available (in the case of A/B tests) or unlikely
 to work (in the case of fixed effects regressions).
 Having clearly outlined the obstacles to correct measurement, we now turn
 to a more positive outlook on methods that can be used to estimate causal
 WOM effects.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Natural Experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tool for causal inference that we think is available to researchers
 in the context of WOM are natural experiments or so-called quasi-experimental
 variation.
 Natural experiments are based on historical data that does not contain
 randomized variation, but isolates specific parts of the historical variations
 in WOM that are driven by exogenous events.
 Importantly, these exogenous events are arguably unrelated to demand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix ideas, we first discuss a concrete example taken from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset

.
 This paper studies the impact of user-generated microblogging activity
 on demand for 
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512079913
(i.e.
 viewership of) 
\change_unchanged
TV shows in China.
 The authors have data on the daily number of tweets pertaining to each
 show as well as viewership numbers for different episodes of the same show.
 Importantly, during the time period covered by their data, the primary
 Chinese microblogging platform, Sina Weibo, was temporarily shut-down due
 to political events.
 The paper harnesses this shock and isolates the variation in microblogging
 activity that is driven by the shut-down in order to isolate the impact
 of the WOM on demand.
 In more formal terms, the authors implement an instrumental variable (IV)
 approach in a panel fixed effect regression framework (similar to the framework
 outlined above).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{jt}=\xi_{j}+\gamma\times WOM{}_{jt}+\nu_{jt}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Demand_{jt}$
\end_inset

 denotes demand for the episode of show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that aired on day 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $WOM_{jt}$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of tweets pertaining to the show on day 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Crucially, the WOM measure in the regression is instrumented with a dummy
 variable that is equal to one if the specific episode aired during the
 shut-down.
 In technical terms, the instruments allows us to estimate the causal impact
 of WOM (in the regression above) even if WOM is correlated with the regression
 error term.
 The sufficient conditions for this method to work is that the instrument
 is not correlated with the regression and hence only affect demand via
 its impact on WOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In general, any event on the platform of interest that affected WOM, but
 that was not directly related to demand would qualify as an instrument

 Thus, before-after comparisons around the natural experiment may be biased.
 Thus, natutal experiments are more convincing when evidence can be furnished

 Such evidence might be hard to find.

 Instead, exploiting such events requires the analyst to find suitable events
 that provide the desired variation.
 Such natural experiments therefore can only provide specific case studies.
 This is in contrast to A/B tests or simpler methods such as fixed effect
 regression which can be implemented repeatedly by firms and provide a standardi
zed and continuous analytical toolkit.
 On the positive side, specific events such as the shut-down or the platform
 merger are often broad in scope and hence can be leveraged to analyze many
 different product markets that were affected by these events due their
 presence on the platform.

 The average rating of each Airbnb property is only disclosed to consumers

 These disclosures can be thought of as a series of small natutal experiments

 The assumption underlying the validity of these natural experiments is
 that the arrival of the third review is unpredictable, and thus uncorrelated

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A/B tests as Instruments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method that is related to the one just outlined, but more readily available
 is an indirect manipulation of WOM.
 The key idea is to use information on any activity that a firm might be
 using to foster WOM among its users.
 For instance, it could be the case that firms is running a targeted advertising
 campaigns to users that provided positive WOM in the past.
 In a setting where the firms sells different products, it could randomly
 assign products to such a targeted advertising campaigns.
 Hence, for some randomly selected set of products, active users are targeted
 with advertising and start generating additional WOM.
 Relative to a standard A/B test the random assignment has been applied
 not directly to the variable of interest, but to an activity (targeted
 advertising in this case) that is under the firm's control and correlated
 with the variable of interest.
 This approach allows us to combine some of the strengths of A/B tests with
 the natural experiment framework.
 Namely, we can now regress demand on WOM and use the randomly assigned
 variable as an instrument for WOM.
 As before, we are thus isolating the variation in WOM that is due to the
 randomly assigned variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Such an approach has the advantage that it is scale-able.
 Contrary to natural experiments, we are not constraint to leverage existing
 variation that might occur infrequently, but can instead generate useful
 (i.e.
 random) variation ourselves.
 At the same time, by applying the A/B test mechanics indirectly, we circumvent
 the issue that WOM is not directly under the firm's control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main downside of this approach is that it might be hard to find intervention
s that affect WOM without also directly affecting demand.
 In our example above, it is likely that the targeted advertising campaign
 not only affect the amount of WOM but also make the users receiving advertising
 more likely to buy the product.
 Hence the instrument will affect demand directly and not only via its impact
 on WOM.
 In this particular case, the problem could be solved if one can track the
 sales of users that were targeted with advertising and only study the impact
 of WOM on demand of users that did not receive any advertising.

Regression discontinuity (RD) is another more readily available approach
 for firms to study the effect of online WOM on demand, in particular online
 reviews.
 This approach explores the discontinuity of some measures of WOM, or the
 discontinuity of some marketing measures that affect WOM.
 The cause of such discontinuity, however, are arguably uncorrelated with
 the variation of demand, hence providing convincing identification for
 the causal inference.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To facilitate an easier exposition, consider a classical example of online
 WOM, Yelp reviews of restaurants.
 As discussed above, directly regressing demand on the average ratings may
 not result in reliable causal inference.
 In this case, we may take advantage of an artificial fact of how Yelp presents
 the ratings to its users.
 The most common way of presenting these reviews to consumers is the average
 rating of a restaurant, which is a unweighted simple average across all
 ratings provided by consumers pertaining to the restaurant.
 When computing the average rating, Yelp (and many other platforms) rounds
 the result to the nearest half star (e.g., 4.0 or 4.5).
 Such a rounding method creates the discontinuity that is uncorrelated with
 demand.
 For example, a restaurant with an average rating of 4.24 and another one
 of 4.25 will be presented as rating 4.0 and 4.5, respectively.
 These two restaurants are arguably having similar quality due to the closeness
 of their actual average ratings (4.24 vs.
 4.25).
 The artificial and much larger difference of 0.5 in ratings due to the rounding,
 however, may lead to variations in demand, which can be attributed to online
 WOM.

Academic interest in consumer reviews goes nearly as far back as the appearance
 of the first online reputation systems on e-commerce platforms like eBay
 and Amazon.
 Reviews – the information units of reputation systems – typically consist
 of a numeric score (typically represented as a rating between 1 and 5 stars),
 the review submission date, and some open-ended text that allows consumers
 to evaluate a business (or a product) in their own words.
 Some reputation systems allow consumers to attach pictures to their reviews,
 and to separately rate businesses on dimensions such as service and price.
 Another commonly implemented feature lets consumers rate others' reviews
 as

 Reputation systems also display certain basic facts about reviewers such
 as their review history, a profile picture, and location, though they do
 not require that reviewers disclose their true identity.
 Most reputation systems allow anyone to submit to review, which has raised
 concerns about review fraud (

 The findings of these papers, which rely on different methods and study

 sell their items with higher probability.
 Interestingly,

 estimate the impact of average ratings on restaurant demand and respectively
 find that a one-star increase in ratings causes a 5% increase in revenue
 and a 50% increase in the probability of being sold out.
 To demonstrate causality, both of these studies rely on a clever regression
 discontinuity (RD) design that exploits the fact that Yelp rounds average
 ratings to the nearest half-star: a business with a 4.24 average is rounded
 down to 4 stars, while a business with a nearly identical rating of 4.25
 stars is up to 4.5 stars.

 Reputation systems do not explicitly display rating variances.
 However, most display histograms of reviews counts broken down by rating.
 By looking at these histograms of ratings consumers can infer their variance.
 Motivated by a theoretical model, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 presents empirical evidence that increased variance in ratings has a positive
 impact on the demand of low-rated products.
 The key intuition behind this result is that low-rated products with some
 high individual ratings (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, high variance) may be appealing to at least acertain subset of consumers,
 while products with consistently low ratings (
\emph on
i.e.

\begin_layout Subsection
Review volume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another salient and well-studied feature of reputation systems is review
 volume.
 Review counts are typically displayed prominently next to average ratings,
 and consumers can also use them to infer quality.
 All else equal, we may expect that consumers will have less uncertainty
 about the quality of products with more reviews.
 Therefore, increases in review volume could lead to increased demand.
 While the hypothesis that changes in review volume affect demand is plausible,
 testing it raises a complex identification challenge: while more reviews
 may cause sales, the reverse is also true, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, increased sales can result in more reviews.
 Finding instruments or plausibly exogenous variation in review volume has
 proven to be difficult.
 Therefore, to resolve this reserve causality issue, researchers have primarily
 relied on experimental methods.

 to study the value of online reputation.
 The experiment was conducted on eBay.
 An postcard seller with established reputation was asked to create a set
 of new ideninties.
 Being new, these identities started out with no reviews, and from the perspecti

 The seller randomly assigned items to be sold under the various identies
 while making sure to offer the same quality of service to all customers.
 The main result of the experiment was that consumers' willingness to pay
 was 8% higher for purchasing from the established seller even though the
 items sold across the various identities were similar.

 can hire workers to perform various tasks.
 The oDesk experiment involved hiring approximately 1,000 workers to perform
 the same data-entry task.
 Workers were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group.
 Treated workers received detailed and objective feedback on their perfromance,
 whereas workers in the control group received equally objective but less
 detailed feedback.
 Treated workers had better future employment outcomes, such as higher wages
 and earnings, compared to workers in the controlled group who performed

Review text is inherently high-dimensional and typically not amenable to
 analysis by the same methods researchers use to study
\change_deleted -503570337 1511884619

 review valence and volume.
 Therefore, most analyses of review text rely on a pre-processing step that
 transforms text into a small number of variables that capture variation
 along dimensions of interest.
 In principle, these variables can subsequently be analyzed using traditional
 econometric approaches.
 However, finding plausibly exogenous variation in existing text is difficult,

The second approach is grounded in consumer behavior theory and starts by
 forming a hypothesis regarding the effects of specific text constructs.
 These constructs are typically detected manually (
\emph on
e.g.
\emph default

 Sometimes, researchers combine this technique with machine learning: after
 manually labeling a small set of reviews, a classifier is trained to predict
 the presence of specific text constucts in larger unlabelled review corpora.
 An advantage of using theory to form hypotheses is that one can design
 experiments to test these hypotheses leading to internally valid estimates.

\begin_layout Standard
Overall, the findings in the literature point towards substantial causal
 effects on the impact of ratings, review volume, and review text on demand.
 In addition to studying these features directly, a number of papers have
 examined various moderators of the relationship between reviews and demand.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A consistent theme that has emerged in the literature is that the relationship
 between ratings and demand (or prices) depends on consumers' prior quality
 uncertainty.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Luca_2016"

\end_inset

 finds that that Yelp ratings do impact the revenue of chain restaurants
 because there exists little a priori uncertainty about their quality.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 find that the impact of TripAdvisor ratings is much smaller for chain-affiliate
d hotels than it is for independently operated properties.
 Also looking at the hotel industry, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hollenbeck2016online"

\end_inset

 investigates the evolution of the relationship between brand value and
 demand and finds that between 2000 and 2015 the impact of branding on revenue
 declined by 50% due increased adoption of consumer reviews.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consumer awareness is another important moderator of the impact of ratings
 on demand.
 In a fascinating study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger2010positive"

\end_inset

 show that even negative reviews can have a positive impact on sales when
 they cause a sufficient increase in awareness.
 By contrast, negative reviews for well-known products decrease sales, as
 expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The provenance of reviews also affects their impact on demand.
 For instance, an emerging feature of reputation systems is the ability
 to read and write reviews via mobile applications.
 Review platforms typically indicate whether a review was written using
 a mobile app or a desktop site.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "grewal2016mobile"

\end_inset

 compare reviews submitted via mobile applications to reviews submitted
 using a desktop a website.
 Using a combination of TripAdvisor data, and lab experiments they show
 that mobile reviews are more persuasive, and thus have a larger impact
 on demand, than desktop reviews.
 The mechanism underlying this effect is that when consumers believe that
 reviewers who use a mobile app have to put in an extra effort in composing
 reviews (e.g., due to the physical limitations of small phone screens), and
 thus their reviews are more trustworthy than review submitted via a traditional
 desktop website.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Demand depends on the timing of reviews with respect to the product life-cycle.
 Relying on meta-analysis, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "babic2016effect"

\end_inset

 find that early reviews are more important in driving the sales for new
 products than they are for new services because service quality can vary
 greatly over time whereas product quality remains relatively fixed.
 Thus recent reviews are far more important for services whereas initial
 reviews are more important for products.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, it worth mentioning that the effects we have discussed above are
 unlikely to represent long-term equilibrium outcomes.
 As consumers pay more attention to the increasing number of reviews accumulatin
g online, the influence of these reviews on demand and pricing will also
 likely become stronger.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "lewis2016welfare"

 provide some evidence for the evolution of these treatment effect by looking
 at hotel demand as a function of TripAdvisor ratings over a decade.

 rating went for zero to 25% between 2004 and 2014.

 they find as driven by WOM.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998786

Apart from the absence of a summary measure such as the average rating,
 there are at least two more important differences between conversations

 First, online conversations have an interactive and social components.
 Reviews instead are posted by consumers after consuming a product and can
 serve to inform 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512342367

\begin_layout Subsection
Volume of Online Conversations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can the volume of online conversations affect sales? Based on the extant
 research, the answer is a qualified yes.
 However, this assessment of effect size is based on only two studies with
 fairly distinct research designs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 study the effect of customer microblogging on TV viewership, which is essential
ly the demand for TV shows.
 Due to a political scandal, the Chinese government temporarily shut down
 the microblogging platform Sina Weibo in 2012, which was the most important
 and popular social media website in China at the time.
 The block inevitably reduced the volume of online conversations pertaining
 to TV shows.
 An important feature of this block is that it was caused by the political
 scandal, such a reduction in online conversation volume is exogenous to
 the demand or the products themselves (TV shows).
 Relying on this exogenous shock, the authors show that the reduction of
 customer conversation volume does lead to lower consumption of TV shows.
 Accordingly, a higher volume of online conversations may increase the demand.
 But the effect size is at a fairly moderate level of 0.016.
 In words, if the volume of online conversations increases by 100%, the
 demand will increase by 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512351873
20
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512351874
1.6
\change_unchanged
%.
 The magnitude of this effect is significantly lower than most previous
 studies.
 For example the meta-analysis of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "you_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

 documents a much larger average elasticity of online WOM of 0.2.
 However, many of the previous studies using observational data of online
 WOM and demand are often subject to the measurement challenges described
 in Section XX, and in our 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512351933
estimation
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512351935
opinion
\change_unchanged
 are likely to overstate the true effect size.
 The paper by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lovett_staelin"

\end_inset

, although not rely on experimental data, also finds online social media
 and WOM have a positive impact on TV viewership with a moderate effect
 size of 0.04, less effective than advertising.

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 study the effect of microblogging on TV viewership.
 The authors execute a field experiment in China which is primarly focused
 on understanding the impact of a firm's tweets about its own TV show (i.e.
 these tweets do not orginate from private users and hence should not be
 understood as WOM).
 However, the paper also investigates one specific form of WOM, by having
 influential users retweet the companies' tweets for a random subset of
 TV shows.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We note that in the US, hiring influential users to promote a firm's products
 does not conform with FTC's truth-in-advertising standards (to conform
 with the standard, the re-tweet would have to indicate that the users was
 paid for the re-tweet).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 They demonstrate that the amount of retweets can boost viewership (demand),
 though the paper does not explicitly calibrate the elasticity.
 This effect is large in magnitude and (although not directly comparable)
 is contrary to the modest effect size found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset

.
 However, the nature of the WOM is very different here.
 Most likely a re-tweet by an influential user will be more impactful than
 a tweet by the average consumer.
 We return to the influence of the sender's identity on WOM effectiveness
 when discusssing moderators of conversational WOM below.

content of online conversations.
 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512361655

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512361875
Similar to online reviews, the content of online conversation is also high-dimen

 Therefore, to study online conversations, it requires the same pre-processing
 steps as reviews, which convert text into a small set of variables of interest
 for analysis.
 One of the most commonly studied dimension is the sentiment expressed in
 the conversations.

 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 find that WOM with positive sentiment enhance sales, and negative WOM reduce
 sales.
 For neutral conversations, they also have a positive effect, potentially
 because they increase the overall volume of conversations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512362745
However, analyzing sentiment in conversations faces the same identification
 challenge where plausibly exogenous variations in field data are rare.
 Accordingly, causal interpreations of the effect of sentiment on demand
 are often difficult.
 In
\change_unchanged
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset


\change_inserted 2105412453 1512365152
, the authors are able to explore the exogenous variation in sentiment of
 conversations to study its impact on demand.
 In their context, the shut-down of the microblogging platform reduced the
 volume of all conversations, including both negative and positive ones.
 Acorss all products (TV shows) contained their data, however, there is
 considerable heterogeneity in the sentiment of each product before or after
 the shut-down.
 Some products in general had more positive conversations, while others
 on average had more negative ones.
 The authors find that, for both shows with more negative conversations
 and those with more positive conversations, when the volume of conversations
 dropped due to the shut-down, they experienced lower demand.
 In other words, conversations with either negative or positive sentiment
 have the same directional effect on demand – less conversations reduce
 demand, more conversations increase demand.

\change_unchanged
 While this finding seems counter-intuitive, it is directly related to the
 mechanisms through which conversations may affect demand, which we will
 further elaborate below.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512364862
In particular, in the case of online conversations, consumption and conversation
s may be complement to each other.
 Namely when a consumer may participate in conversations about the product,
 it may enhance her enjoyment of the consumption.
 In this case, the act of conversation itself is affecting the consumption
 decision, but the sentiment of the conversation, positive or negative,
 is less relevant.
 Instead, when complementarity is the key channel, both types of sentiment
 may enhance demand, because they may simply be the indicator of a heated
 or even controversial debate among enthusiastic consumers.

\change_unchanged
 and the timing of the conversation leads to a differential impact of conversati

 We analyzed similar moderators, namely the

.
 The characteristics of the consumer engaged in the conversation is likely
 to be more important as consumers are likely to process the average rating
 and total number of reviews without analyzing the identities of the users
 which posted the reviews.
 Instead, the interactive nature of conversation makes it more likely that
 there is heterogeneity in how impactful specific participants in the conversati
on are.
 Finally, conversations can take place before or after a purchase and both
 types of conversations might influence consumers.

 we would reverse the order.

Before discussing the moderators, it may be constructive for the discussion
 to first consider 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512366986
There are at least
\change_unchanged
 three channels through which online conversations may affect consumers'
 decisions and consequently the overall demand.
 The three channels are, information, persuasion, and complementarity.
 Informative effects can arise when online conversations among customers
 generate or disseminate product/brand information that resolves uncertainty
 about the product, enhances the awareness, or purely remind customers about
 the product.
 Persuasive effects may enhance customers' preference towards the product,
 even without delivering information.
 We should note that these two channels are often intertwined and difficult
 to distinguish in practice.
 Lastly, complementarity between online conversations and product consumption
 may happen when customers derive a higher utility from the product consumption
 if they can participate in the online conversations with others who share
 the same interest in the product.
 For example, people may enjoy watching a sports event more when they participar
t in online discussions about the event with others.
 These conceptual framework of the three channels was initially proposed
 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Bagwell_2007"

\end_inset

 for analyzing advertising's impact.
 Although online conversations differ from advertising, the framework may
 be generalized to any kind of information provision, also including online
 conversations.
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512365492

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512366136
Because of the informative and persuasive effects of conversations, one
 potential moderator of conversations' impact on demand is consumers' uncertaint
y about the product's quality or value.
 Consider a product where consumers are rather uncertain about its quality.
 Informative online conversations can surely reduce the uncertainty and
 play a role in shaping consumption decisions.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "moretti_2011"

\end_inset

 evaluates how customers obtain information about the quality of movies
 from peers before making their decisions.
 Such quality information derived from conversations directly affects consequent
 sales of the produt.
 In this paper, however, we should note that the data do not have direct
 measurement of online conversations, and the conversations can happen both
 online and offline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512366275
A second possible moderator is the trustworthiness of participants in the
 conversation.
 This is especially true if the main role of conversations is informative
 or persuasive.
 In the literature of network effect where an individual's decision depends
 on others' in her network, it is well documented that an influential consumer's
 decision may greatly impact those in her network (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

LatexCommand citet
key "harikesh_2010"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

).
 We conjecture that such patterns may be applied to the current context
 as well, where the online posts by influentials can be crucial in affecting
 others' consumption.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gong_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

, for example, the authors show that when a firm's tweets were re-tweeted
 by influential users, it led to addtional demand, which mainly came from
 the followers of those influentials.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512367775
A third moderator is the timing of the conversations.
 In the case of reviews, the exposure to reviews before the consumption
 may affect a consumer's decision.
 For conversations, it may happen both before and after the consumption.
 We note that recent studies find that even the conversations after the
 consumption (more precisely, the anticipation of the post-consumption conversat
ions), may affect a consumer's consumption decision.
 This finding is directly linked to the 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512367199
The 
\change_unchanged
third 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512367205
mechanism
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512367223
channel through which conversations affect demand
\change_unchanged
, the complementarity between conversations and product consumption
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512368483
.
 In particular, for some products, the uncertainty regarding quality or
 value cannot be resolved even after the consumption.
 Such products are termed as credence products.
 Automobile repairs, medical procedures, and dietary supplements are good
 examples of such products.
 There are also some products, whose values/quality are fairly subjective,
 for example, a TV show, a movie, or a concert.
 In this case, because the values/quality are difficult to assess, both
 before and after the consumption, the post-consumption conversations may
 become an important complement to the consumption.

Research on the relationship between online conversations and demand is

\begin_layout Standard

The first potential moderator is consumers' uncertainty about the product's
 quality or value.
 Consider a product where consumers are rather uncertain about its quality.
 Per the discussion of the mechanisms above, information is a channel through
 which online conversations affect demand.
 As a result, informative online conversations can surely reduce the uncertainty
 and play a role in shaping consumption decisions.
 Furthermore, for some products, the uncertainty regarding quality or value
 cannot be resolved even after the consumption.
 Such products are termed as credence products.
 Automobile repairs, medical procedures, and dietary supplements are good
 examples of such products.
 There are also some products, whose values/quality are fairly subjective,
 for example, a TV show or a concert.
 In this case, because the values/quality are difficult to assess, both
 before and after the consumption, we suspect the complementarity channel
 may be especially important, where part of the utility is derived from
 the conversations, where the value/quality of the product becomes less
 critical.

SS: It would be good to have some organizing principle here.
 It feels like a fairly disconnected list of topics: I.e.
 what tools do firms in principle have at their disposition to influence
 WOM.
 I think there is an entire literature that thinks about such issues, such
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

seeding
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 WOM campaigns.
 If we want to tackle this topic, I think you would have to read up on that
 literature.
 Some of the stuff below also seems to relate only indirectly to how firms
 can influence WOM.
 For instance which products are talked about more often seems less related
 to influencing WOM (unless one things of only releasing products that will
 garner WOM).
 The same is true for message fit, what exactly does this imply for firms'
 WOM strategy? In any case, some kind of general structure is needed for
 this paragraph to make sense.

Having established that online conversations, especially the volume, may
 affect demand, it is tricky in understanding what actually drives the volume.

The sentiment of conversations may be much more difficult to control, and
 manipulating the sentiment potentially has some legal and ethical implications.
 Furthermore, when the complementarity channel is at work, even conversations
 with negative sentiment can increase demand (see Section XXX).
 We will mainly focus on the discussion on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

volume.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 For example, what types of content are more likely be shared among users
 in their conversations, and what types of individuals on social media platforms
 are more likely to share or forward content?

\change_deleted 2105412453 1512322470
A number of studies have investigated how content of online conversations
 may affect the spread and hence enhance the overall volume of online conversati
ons.
 For example, through a series of studies, Berger and coauthors evaluate
 what content and products are more likely to be discussed on social network.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger2011"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger_milkman"

\end_inset

 suggest content or products that result in certain emotions (e.g., anxiety
 or amusement) are more likely to lead to more social sharing and online
 conversations.
 Such emotions are often associated with high level of awareness, alert,
 or attention of customers.
 In contrast, some other emotions, such as sadness, are less likely to lead
 to more social sharing and online conversations.
 In another study, using both field experiments and lab experiments, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger_schwartz"

\end_inset

 show that, on one hand, interesting products may generate more immediate
 conversations, but the attention may diminish soon.
 In the long run, these products receive less ongoing discussion over time.
 On the other hand, products that are more publicly visible enjoy a more
 sustainable WOM trend among customers.
 Using twitter data, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 further highlight the importance of fit between message content and the
 interest of the user.
 When the content of a message fits a user's interest, which is identified
 using the user's past tweets, the message is more often rebroadcasted by
 the user.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_deleted 2105412453 1512322470
Another stream of research consider the question of how to identify the
 types of users who are more crucial in driving the volume of online conversatio
ns.
 For example, since the seminal work by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Katz_Lazarsfeld_1955"

\end_inset

, there are abundant studies that emphasize the importance of influential
 users' impact on others in the network (e.g.,

key "harikesh_2010"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "IVV_2011"

\end_inset

).
 It is intuitive to generalize the argument that on social media platforms
 influential users may affect the broadcasting decisions of others in their
 network.
 As a result, some studies that focus on identifying the influential users
 and users' susceptibility to influence from others (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,

We should note that, as

 still debatable – A large cluster of easily influenced individuals may
 be more important than influential users.

One problematic approach is to directly gauge which types or groups of customers
 have more activities on social media.
 As discussed in Section XX, such an approach can be biased and often overestima
te the roles of certain groups of customers in enhancing online conversations.
 For example, suppose a firm released a new product and subsequently observed
 there was a large uptick in online conversations originated from some certain
 geographic areas.
 It happened to be the case that, due to limited inventory, the product
 was only initially rolled out in those areas.
 It would be erroneous to draw the inference that customers in those areas
 were more crucial in driving online conversations about the product.
 To avoid such incorrect conclusions, many studies rely on exogenous variations
 in data to derive inference.

, for example, use a large scale of field experiment on Facebook to investigate
 which types of customers are more likely to influence or be influenced
 on a social network.
 They randomly choose recipients out of a representative sample of 1.3 million
 Facebook users to receive messages from their friends about a product.
 They then monitor the adoption behavior of these users as well as collect
 demographic information of these users and of those from whom they receive
 the messages.

While the exact key performance indicator (KPI) or outcome variable in this
 study is the adoption of a product instead of the increase in conversation
 volume, the product can be easily conceptualized as online conversation
 such as a tweet.
 Correspondingly, the adoption of the product is the rebroadcasting of the
 tweet.

 They find that older users are less susceptible than their younger counterparts
, women are less influential than men, but can influence men more than they
 do on other women, and married individuals are the least likely to be influence
d.
 Interestingly, influential users are less susceptible than non-influential
 users and they are more likely to cluster together in the network.
 This finding suggests that the spread of products or message in a network
 may crucially depend on influential people with influential friends.

In this study, the field experiments renders the results more convincing
 because it helps mitigating different potential biases.
 First, because of the random assignment of the treatment, it avoids confounding
 factors such as selection bias where firms or the platform specifically
 choose to target customers who previously show more interests in related
 conversations or products.
 Second, the experiments also uses identical messages which eliminate the
 heterogeneity often seen in tailored/curated content that may affect customers'
 responses.

As another example that follow a similar strategy to avoid biased inference,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lambrecht_trend_twitter"

\end_inset

 use field experiments on Twitter to study whether early trend propagators
 are more likely to spread words about firms and products.
 To be specific, they collaborate with two companies who post content (ads)
 on Twitter.
 Using user past activities on Twitter, they identify users who share early
 trendy topics on Twitter more often, i.e., early trend propagators.
 They randomly target the content at those early trend propagators and those
 who only embrace trends later.
 Next, they monitor the users to see who are more likely to tweet or retweet
 the content.
 While the conventional wisdom suggests that the early trend propagators
 should be more likely to disseminate the content, they do not find such
 evidence in the data.
 In fact, they find exactly the opposite where consumers who are not early
 trend propagators are more likely to tweet or retweet the content.
