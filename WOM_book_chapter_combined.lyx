One of the biggest shifts in the marketing landscape in recent years has
 been a shift towards social media platforms to advertise products or have
 consumers advocate on the brand's behalf.
 Marketing spending on social media is projected to amount to 20% of marketing
 budgets by 2020 and online word-of-mouth (WOM) is considered to be one
 of the most effective forms of marketing by many marketing executive.
 At the same time, systematic empirical evidence on the effectiveness of
 paid and earned advertising is relatively scant.

This is partly due to social media marketing being a relatively recent phenomeno
n, but partly also due to unique measurement challenges in this area which
 we outline in detail below.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this chapter we outline the current state of the academic literature
 on the impact of online WOM on demand.
 We first outline measurement challenges in the realm of WOM and how they
 can be resolved.
 We then summarize recent findings on the effectiveness of WOM in two domains:
 customer reviews and online conversations about brands on platforms like
 twitter or other social media.
 The former are a type of activity that typically occurs after consumption
 and that imposes a specific structure (often a rating scale) on consumers'
 WOM.
 The latter instead are less structured and can take place before or after
 consumption.
 These two areas are 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512682743

\change_unchanged

\begin_layout Standard
In order to understand the measurement challenges and possible solutions
 when estimating the impact of WOM, it is instructive to draw parallels
 to the measurement of advertising effectiveness.
 The approaches to estimation in both realms share some common features,
 but also diverge in 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512682832
important
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512682833
several
\change_unchanged
 ways
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512682837
 which we outline below
\change_unchanged
.

\change_inserted -1412874244 1512682851
 Importantly, methods for measuring advertising effectiveness, which are
 fairly well developed, cannot be directly applied to measuring the impact
 of WOM.
 Hence, marketing managers need to develop new frameworks for measuring
 WOM impact.
 We outline several methods below and discuss the situations in which they
 can be applied.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As an illustration for the general measurement framework we consider the
 case of a firm offering multiple products that are characterized by different
 advertising and WOM intensit
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512682859
ies
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512682858
y
\change_unchanged
.
 The firm has historic data on marketing
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512682981
 activit

ies
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512869489
y
\change_unchanged
, i.e.
 WOM and advertising, and demand (e.g.
 quantity sold, click-through rates, conversions) at the product-level and
 wishes to understand the impact of advertising and WOM on demand.
 The general logic of our arguments below easily extends to situations where
 data are available at the consumer rather than the product level.

\change_inserted -1412874244 1512683408
 For the remainder of this section, we refer generically to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

WOM intensity

 and do not distinguish between specific types of WOM such as the number

\change_inserted -1412874244 1512683408

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Cross-sectional inference
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simple approach for measurement using a standard linear regression framework
 would be to regress some measure of demand on each type of marketing activity
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{j}=\alpha+\beta\times Marketing_{j}+\varepsilon_{j}
\]

\end_inset

where the index 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 refers to a product.
 One would then run a separate regression using either advertising or 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512873095
word-of-mouth
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512873095
WOM
\change_unchanged
 as the explanatory marketing variable.
 This regression effectively compares products with high and low advertising
 / WOM and ask whether demand increases or decreases as a function of 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512873125
the 
\change_unchanged
marketing
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512873129
 activity of interest
\change_unchanged
.
 In order for the effect of marketing on demand, captured by the coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, to be interpreted as a 
\shape italic
causal
\shape default
 effect, 
\begin_inset Formula $Marketing_{j}$
\end_inset

 needs to be uncorrelated with the regression error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, any factor that might influence demand, such as the quality of the
 product, has to be uncorrelated with advertising / WOM.
 Random assignment of marketing in an A/B-test setting does assure that
 there is no correlation.
 Here we contemplate the situation 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512683045
of historic data on demand and marketing activity 
\change_unchanged
where marketing activity is not necessarily randomly assigned.
 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512525709
In fact, the very purpose of marketing departments would generally be to
 systematically allocate marketing dollars differentially across products.

\change_unchanged
 We 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512526285
discuss in turn advertising and WOM below
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512612222
start with a discussion of (the more familiar case of) measuring advertising
 impact as a reference point and then highlight similarities and differences
 regarding WOM impact
\change_unchanged
.
 In each case we need to assess which underlying factors lead to a given
 level of the relevant activity in the historic
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512873227
al
\change_unchanged
 data used in the regression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to advertising, we need to ask ourselves whether marketing
 activity is correlated with any factors that also affect demand directly
 (and that are therefore captured in 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 A likely scenario in many settings is the case where popular products that
 sold well in the past are advertised more heavily.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product popularity
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is correlated with advertising intensity and also influences demand.
 Or put differently, products with high advertising levels would have enjoyed
 high demand even in the absence of advertising due to their inherent popularity.
 Such a correlation will lead to an overestimation of the impact of advertising
 on demand.
 As we show in more detail below, it does indeed seem to be the case that
 an upward bias typically occurs in 
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512683057
cross-sectional 
\change_unchanged
studies of advertising impact.

 in studies of online advertising (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Lewis_Reiley_2014"

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of WOM, a similar type of bias can occur for slightly different
 reasons.
 Contrary to advertising, WOM is not directly under the firm's control,
 and hence we need to ask whether any product characteristics that lead
 consumers to talk about the product might also have a direct effect on
 demand.
 Here a scenario of reverse causality seems likely, i.e., high demand products
 that a lot of consumers buy will likely also be talked about by a lot of
 consumers.
 This relationship does indeed seem fairly mechanical.
 While consumer might talk about products even without buying them, it seems
 likely that a higher number of purchases will lead to a larger number of
 people that can potentially talk about the product online.
 Note that there is some parallel to the mechanism that caused upward bias
 in the relationship of advertising and demand.
 Inherently more attractive and popular products tend to be advertised more
 heavily and garner more WOM.
 Hence, a simple cross-sectional analysis of WOM is likely to also overstate
 its effectiveness.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Inference with panel data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative approach that deals with some of the problems outlined above
 is one that relies on panel data with fixed effects at the level of the
 cross-sectional unit.
 Such an analysis requires data on demand and marketing for various products
 over time, which is often available to firms.
 The fixed effect regression takes the following form
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Demand_{jt}=\xi_{j}+\gamma\times Marketing_{jt}+\nu_{jt}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\noindent
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

 denotes the fixed effect for product 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset


\change_deleted -1412874244 1512683453
 that stays invariant over time
\change_unchanged
.
 Note also that demand and marketing are now indexed by 
\begin_inset Formula $(jt)$
\end_inset

 to indicate that we have product/time-period specific data on those variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In contrast to the cross-sectional approach, we are now relating changes
 in marketing over time to changes in demand.
 I.e.
 we are asking whether in time-periods with relatively higher marketing
 intensity (for a given product) demand for that product increases.
 Importantly, any product characteristics that do not change over time do
 not pose a problem when using this approach because we control for the
 influence of such factors through product fixed effects (
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{j}$
\end_inset

).
 For instance products that are more popular might have higher 
\shape italic
levels
\shape default
 of marketing and demand, but this is unproblematic because the regression
 is relating changes over time in both marketing and demand to each other,
 while controlling 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512683461
the
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512683461
for
\change_unchanged
 time-invariant popularity levels through the fixed effects.
 Hence in terms of threat to a causal interpretation of the impact of marketing,
 we need to consider whether there are 
\shape italic
time-varying
\shape default
 factors that correlate with marketing and also have a direct effect on
 demand.
 In the case of advertising we are cautiously optimistic that the approach
 above will recover the correct causal estimate.
 It is however much less likely to be an approach that can be applied to
 measuring WOM effectiveness.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to advertising we need to ask whether time periods in which
 advertising levels are higher are systematically different from other time
 periods in terms of demand.
 Whether this is the case again depends on the process by which advertising
 is set and that causes it to vary over time.
 In many markets there exists relatively high frequency variation in advertising
 such as for instance in consumer packages goods where supermarkets advertise
 different products through feature advertising leaflets in different weeks.
 In this market, advertising is often 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

locked in
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in advance through longer-term advertising plans between manufacturers
 and advertisers.
 Consequently, the specific weeks in which advertising is run are not chosen
 in a particularly strategic way (
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rossi_2014"

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_Yao_2017"

\end_inset

).
 Hence in such cases the panel approach is likely to yield a causal estimate.
 Some empirical evidence also points in the direction that fixed effects
 regressions work well in this context.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "shapiro_drug_ads"

\end_inset

 finds that estimates change little when moving from fixed effects to more
 rigorous controls.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Gordon_Hartmann_2013"

\end_inset

 find that in the case of political advertising controlling for (market-level)
 fixed effects leads to a substantial reduction in effect size whereas further
 controls change effect magnitude to a lesser degree.
 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512683477
Of course, the validity of such an approach needs to be assessed on a case-by-ca
se basis.
 An example of a situation where the approach is not valid would be the
 heavy advertising of turkey around thanksgiving.
 In this time period sales of turkey would be higher even in the absence
 of advertising and hence attributing the demand increase to the concurrent
 advertising increase likely incorrect.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning to WOM, we think that the panel approach is less likely to work
 in this setting.
 This is due to an extension of the argument made in the cross-sectional
 case above.
 If demand increases for a given product over time, it is likely that WOM
 intensity increases as a result of the higher demand.
 For instance, consider a setting where we analyze data from a TV show over
 time and find that when viewership of the show increased, WOM also tended
 to be higher.
 It is very likely that higher viewership was causing higher WOM levels
 rather than the other way around.
 In the case of advertising such changes over time could also happen, for

 sales increases.
 However this relationship is likely to be less direct than in the case

As we argued above, simple cross-sectional measurement of advertising and
 WOM effectiveness is likely to suffer from an upward bias, i.e.
 both types of marketing will tend to appear more effective than they actually
 are.
 There is some evidence in the existing literature that such bias does indeed
 incur.
 With regards to advertising the first piece of evidence comes from comparing
 estimates of advertising effectiveness between correlational studies and
 studies with a careful causal design.
 The small set of papers in the latter category (e.g.

 There is also a large literature on online advertising that provides causal

 tend to find effects that are much smaller than correlational estimates.
 Causal advertising elasticities in such studies are estimated to be around
 0.03, i.e.
 doubling advertising increases sales by 3 percent, whereas correlational
 estimates are on average equal to 0.12 (see the meta-analysis in

An important point with regards to the decision of how to allocate dollars
 across different marketing channels is the fact that while both advertising
 and WOM elasticity are biased upwards, the magnitude of the bias is not
 identical.
 Existing evidence suggests that the upward bias is larger in the case of
 WOM and hence one might incorrectly conclude the WOM is more effective
 than advertising.
 Specifically, WOM compares favorably with advertising when considering
 correlational studies with elasticities of 0.12 and 0.2 for advertising and
 WOM respectively.
 The relative effectiveness however flips when we focus on causal estimates
 which yield an elasticities of 0.03 and 0.016 for advertising and WOM.
 It is however important to point out that there are few causal studies
 and hence our statement with regards to relative effectiveness should be
 taken with caution at this point.

 it is by construction not correlated with the

 Running an A/B-test requires direct control of the variable of interests,
 e.g.
 the company's tweets in the example above, in order to implement a random

 In the case of WOM however, firms will generally not have the ability to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We note that there could be situations where an experimental manipulation
 of WOM is feasible, but the scope for such manipulations is likely to be
 limited.
 For instance, in principle one could imagine that a social media platform
 could decide not to show tweets pertaining to a randomly selected group
 of products.
 A firm that was interested in studying the impact of WOM and was able to
 convince the platform to co-operate in the experiment could achieve an
 experimental manipulation of WOM due to randomly elimination of tweets
 across products.
 Our sense is that platforms will be unlikely to cooperate in such experiments
 as there might be backlash
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512880503

\change_unchanged
 from users whose tweets do not appear due to the A/B test.
 A further option would be randomly generate rather than eliminate WOM by
 generating tweets from fake accounts or incentivizing users to tweets on

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Natural Experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Natural experiments are a useful tool for causal inference that is sometimes
 available to researchers interested in measuring the causal impact of WOM
 on demand.
 Natural experiments
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512684310
, also known as quasi-experimental variation,
\change_unchanged
 rely on historical data that happens to contain events that affect WOM
 but are otherwise unrelated to demand.
 These events are used to isolate exogenous variation in the historical
 patterns of WOM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To fix ideas, we begin by discussing a concrete example from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset

 who study the impact of user-generated microblogging on Chinese TV show
 viewership.
 The authors have access to historical data on the daily number of tweets
 related to each show as well as the viewership numbers for different episodes
 of the same show.
 During the time period covered by the data, Sina Weibo – the most popular
 Chinese microblogging platform – was unexpectedly shut-down for a brief
 period of time
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512684319
, creating a natural experiment
\change_unchanged
.
 The shutdown qualifies as a natural experiment because it was driven by
 political events that are highly unlikely to have been related to TV viewership
 rates.
 Therefore, the sudden change in microblogging activity
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512609995
 
\change_unchanged
 due to the shut-down can be used to estimate the causal impact of the WOM
 on demand.
 
\change_inserted -503570337 1512406073

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted -1412874244 1512611334
In order to isolate the variation in WOM driven by the natural experiment
\change_unchanged
, the authors implement an instrumental variable (IV) approach in a panel
 fixed-effect regression framework (similar to the framework outlined above):
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Viewership_{jt}=\xi_{j}+\gamma\times WOM{}_{jt}+\nu_{jt}
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Viewership_{jt}$
\end_inset

 denotes demand for the episode of show 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 that aired on day 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $WOM_{jt}$
\end_inset

 denotes the number of tweets about the show on day 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 To isolate exogenous variation in WOM, the WOM measure is instrumented
 with a dummy variable that is equal to one 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512684376
if 
\change_unchanged
for episodes 
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512684379
that 
\change_unchanged
aired during the shut-down, and zero otherwise.
 This regression recovers the causal impact of WOM on demand if the instrument
 and the error term are uncorrelated, even if WOM itself is correlated with
 the error term.

In general, any event that affects WOM without directly affecting demand
 qualifies as a natural experiment.
 Another example of such an event is the merger of two review platforms
 studied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

.
 Prior to the merger the two platforms were collecting reviews separately,
 each platform computing average ratings using its own database of reviews.
 The merger of the review databases led to a sudden change in average ratings.
 Similar to the shut-down of Sina Weibo, the the merger of the two review
 databases in unlikely to have been related to demand.
 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512684394
Thus the merger can be thought of as a natural experiment.
 
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main difficulty in using natural experiments as a tool for causal inference
 is identifying the natural experiments in the first place.
 Events that cause 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512684400
large 
\change_unchanged
exogenous changes in the status quo are rare, and pinpointing them often
 requires expert domain knowledge.
 Moreover, arguing for the suitability of different events as a natural
 experiments has to be done on a case-by-case basis.
 This is in contrast to methods like A/B testing and fixed-effects regressions,
 which can be readily implemented by firms to provide a standardized 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512684428
and continuous 
\change_unchanged
analytical toolkit.
 Despite this limitation, because natural experiments are usually broad
 in scope, once identified, they can be leveraged to analyze different product
 markets and outcomes of interest.

\change_inserted -1412874244 1512684577
 For example, both the shut-down and the merger described above constitute
 platform wide shocks that can the used to study WOM effects for any set
 of products represented on the respective platform.
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A second limitation of natural experiments is that they can yield estimates
 that 
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512611264
are
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512611266
tend to be
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512611268

\change_deleted -1412874244 1512611273
Similar to traditional 
\series bold
(??? help – better keyword than traditional guys???)

 experiments run by firms, natural experiments trade-off internal for external
 validity.
 
\change_unchanged
For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 can estimate the causal impact of ratings in July 2013, the date of the
 review platform merger.
 This natural experiment cannot provide insight as to the magnitude of the
 treatment effect at other points in time
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512611254
 without further assumption
\change_deleted -1412874244 1512611286
, thus limiting its external validity
\change_unchanged
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final concern with natural experiments, especially those causing large
 changes to the status quo, is that firms or individuals may anticipate
 them and strategically adjust their behavior.
 In this case, comparisons of outcomes shortly before and shortly after
 the natural experiment can result in biased estimates.
 Thus, natural experiments are more convincing when evidence can be furnished
 that they were unpredictable.
 An indicative (but not conclusive) piece of evidence is the absence of
 pre-treatment trends.
 To the extent that natural experiments are unpredictable, patterns of the
 outcome variable just before the natural experiment should look similar
 to historical patterns.
 Unexplained systematic variation prior to the natural experiment may suggest
 the natural experiment is invalid.

 prices of Airbnb properties.
 The average rating of each Airbnb property is only disclosed to consumers
 once the property has accumulated three reviews.
 These disclosures can be thought of as a series of small natutal experiments
 – one for each Airbnb property reaching three reviews.
 The assumption underlying the validity of these natural experiments is
 that the arrival of the third review is unpredictable, and thus uncorrelated
 with unobserved demand variation.
 Moreover, these experiments are

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 would be an uninformative event.

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
A/B tests as Instruments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A method that is related to the one just outlined, but more readily available
 is an indirect manipulation of WOM.
 The key idea is to use information on any activity that a firm might be
 using to foster WOM among its users.
 For instance, it could be the case that firms is running a targeted advertising
 campaigns to users that provided positive WOM in the past.
 In a setting where the firms sells different products, it could randomly
 assign products to such a targeted advertising campaigns.
 Hence, for some randomly selected set of products, active users are targeted
 with advertising and start generating additional WOM.
 Relative to a standard A/B test the random assignment has been applied
 not directly to the variable of interest, but to an activity (targeted
 advertising in this case) that is under the firm's control and correlated
 with the variable of interest.
 This approach allows us to combine some of the strengths of A/B tests with
 the natural experiment framework.
 Namely, we can now regress demand on WOM and use the randomly assigned
 variable as an instrument for WOM.
 As before, we are thus isolating the variation in WOM that is due to the
 randomly assigned variable.

 The authors randomly alter the Facebook interface of some users such that
 they become more likely to provide feedback (such as likes) to other users
 in their network.
 They then study the impact of the altered feedback behavior of the affected
 users on the behavior of their peers.
 Although this study does not measure the impact of WOM on demand but rather
 on user behavior within Facebook, the general framework is identical to
 the one described above.
 In this case, the assignment to an interface that makes feedback more likely
 serves as an instrument for the actual feedback behavior.

Such an approach
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512613950
 based on A/B tests
\change_unchanged
 has the advantage that it is scale-able.
 Contrary to natural experiments, we are not constraint to leverage existing
 variation that might occur infrequently, but can instead generate useful
 (i.e.
 random) variation ourselves.
 At the same time, by applying the A/B test mechanics indirectly, we circumvent
 the issue that WOM is not directly under the firm's control.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main downside of this approach is that it might be hard to find intervention
s that affect WOM without also directly affecting demand.
 In our 
\change_inserted -1412874244 1512613983
first

example above, it is likely that the targeted advertising campaign not only
 affect the amount of WOM but also make the users receiving advertising
 more likely to buy the product.
 Hence the instrument will affect demand directly and not only via its impact
 on WOM.
 In this particular case, the problem could be solved if one can track the
 sales of users that were targeted with advertising and only study the impact
 of WOM on demand of users that did not receive any advertising.

\begin_layout Standard
A final approach that can be useful to measure the impact of a specific
 type of WOM is a regression discontinuity (RD) approach.
 While this approach is more narrow in its application to the context of
 WOM, it does provide a broadly applicable approach to measuring the impact
 of review valence, i.e.
 the impact of a higher average review rating (e.g., 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

,

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach is most easily explained by focusing on the particular application
 to review valence.
 A common way of presenting the average rating score of a particular product
 to users is through a star rating that is rounded to the nearest half star.
 Yelp (as well as many other platforms) present average ratings in this
 particular way.
 The rounding generates a discontinuous jump in the perceived rating, and
 two products with very similar underlying scores might take on different
 values on the half-star scale.
 For instance two products with average ratings of 4.24 and 4.26 will be presented
 as rating 4 and 4.5 star products, respectively.
 We can compare such products which are characterized by similar continuous
 scores but different star ratings to isolate the impact of the star rating.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that this is different from comparing ALL products with say 4 versus
 4.5 stars.
 It is reasonable to believe that products with higher star ratings are
 systematically different along other dimensions that correlate with demand.
 Instead, those products near the rounding threshold are likely to be similar
 except for their perceived star ratings.
 Hence the causal impact of the star ratings can be obtained by comparing
 demand for products marginally above and marginally below the rounding
 threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This approach leverages the specific institutional feature of rounded star
 ratings.
 Because of the ubiquitous usage of rounding in star ratings across platforms,
 it does make the RD design a widely applicable approach when studying the
 valence of reviews.
 Importantly, any firm that sells multiple products through a platform that
 uses rounded rating scores can find the subset of products in their assortment
 that have ratings close to the rounding cut-offs and implement this approach.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Contrary to natural experiments, RD thus provides a scale-able and broadly
 applicable approach to measuring WOM effectiveness.
 The approach is however limited in scope to the analysis of review valence
 and cannot be easily applied to study the impact of other aspects of WOM
 such as the number of reviews.

\begin_layout Standard
Although online WOM has become an essential component of the marketing mix,
 measuring its effectiveness on demand remains a challenging task.
 In most field data, demand and WOM may be inherently correlated because
 the same factors that influence demand can affect WOM as well.
 Consequently, studies using field data without acccounting for the correlation
 often overestimate the effectiveness of WOM, resulting in biased conclusions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Three solutions that can be used to address the bias, namely natural experiments
, A/B tests, and regression discontinuity (RD).
 In the following, we detail some studies that exemplify these methods.

Academic interest in consumer reviews goes nearly as far back as the appearance
 of the first online reputation systems on e-commerce platforms like eBay
 and Amazon.
 Reviews – the information units of reputation systems – typically consist
 of a numeric score (typically represented as a rating between 1 and 5 stars),
 the review submission date, and some open-ended text that allows consumers
 to evaluate a business (or a product) in their own words.
 Some reputation systems allow consumers to attach pictures to their reviews,
 and to separately rate businesses on dimensions such as service and price.
 Another commonly implemented feature lets consumers rate others' reviews
 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

helpful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

useful
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Reputation systems also display certain basic facts about reviewers such
 as their review history, a profile picture, and location, though they do
 not require that reviewers disclose their true identity.

\begin_layout Standard
The most common way in which reputation systems aggregate the plethora of
 information they collect is to compute an average rating for each business
 or product.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
An average rating is simply the 
\emph on
unweighted
\emph default
 mean of all individual ratings a business or product has received, often
 rounded to the nearest decimal point of half-star.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Average ratings, which are meant to capture overall quality, are prominently
 displayed and used to rank products and businesses in response to user
 queries.
 For instance, the query 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

hotels in San Francisco
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on TripAdvisor is likely to return higher-rated hotels as the top search
 results.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe due to their wide use and simplicity, average ratings have been well-studi
ed.
 By now, it is well-established that average ratings have a substantial
 causal impact on demand and pricing, though the magnitude of this effects
 varies by timing and context.

 to rate each other, was among the first to be studied and has been the

 The findings of these papers, which rely on different methods and study
 different eBay product categories are broadly consistent: highly-rated
 sellers attract more bidders in their auctions, fetch higher prices, and
 sell their items with higher probability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar effects for review valence have been demonstrated on other review
 and e-commerce platforms.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 find that the sales ranks of books on Amazon depend on their average ratings.
 Looking at Yelp

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 estimate the impact of average ratings on restaurant demand and respectively
 find that a one-star increase in ratings causes a 5% increase in revenue
 and a 50% increase in the probability of being sold out.
 To demonstrate causality, both of these studies rely on the RD design described
 at the end of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 Using the same RD strategy 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 study ZocDoc, a platform that allows consumers to rate doctors and make
 appointments with them, and find that a half-star increase in ratings is
 associated with 10% increase that an appointment will be filled.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More recently, reviews and ratings have become important components of peer-to-p
eer markets like Airbnb and Uber.
 These markets connect consumers with individual suppliers, most of whom
 have no outside reputation.
 To inform consumers about the quality of suppliers, peer-to-peer markers
 rely on reviews.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "proserpio2016you"

\end_inset

 estimate the impact of Airbnb ratings on Airbnb properties using a natural
 experiment: the average rating of each Airbnb property is only disclosed
 to consumers once the property has accumulated three reviews.
 These disclosures can be thought of as a collection of natural experiments
 – one for each Airbnb property reaching three reviews.
 These disclosures can be used to estimate a causal effect under the assumption
 that the arrival of the third review is unpredictable, and thus uncorrelated
 with unobserved variation in demand.
 The study finds that the disclosure of a perfect 5-star rating raises prices
 by approximately 2%.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While many studies have investigated the impact of average ratings, less
 is known about other aggregate measures.
 One exception is the work of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sun2012variance"

\end_inset

 who studies the variance of ratings.
 Reputation systems do not explicitly display rating variances.
 However, most display histograms of reviews counts broken down by rating.
 By looking at these histograms of ratings consumers can infer their variance.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sun2012variance"

\end_inset

 presents empirical evidence that increased variance in ratings has a positive
 impact on the demand of low-rated products.
 The key intuition behind this result is that low-rated products with some
 high individual ratings (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, high variance) may be appealing to at least a certain subset of consumers,
 while products with consistently low ratings (
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, low variance) are less likely to be appealing to anyone.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Review volume
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another salient and well-studied feature of reputation systems is review
 volume.
 Review counts are typically displayed prominently next to average ratings,
 and consumers can also use them to infer quality.
 All else equal, we may expect that consumers will have less uncertainty
 about the quality of products with more reviews.
 Therefore, increases in review volume could lead to increased demand.
 While the hypothesis that changes in review volume affect demand is plausible,
 testing it raises a complex identification challenge: while more reviews
 may cause sales, the reverse is also true, 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, increased sales can result in more reviews.
 Finding instruments or plausibly exogenous variation in review volume has
 proven to be difficult.
 Therefore, to resolve this reserve causality issue, researchers have primarily
 relied on experimental methods.

 For the experiment, an eBay postcard seller with an established reputation

 The new identities had no reviews associated with them, and from the perspectiv

 The seller randomly assigned items to be sold under the various identies
 while making sure to offer the same quality of service to all customers.
 Consumers' willingness to pay was 8% higher for purchasing from the established
 seller even though the items sold across the various identities were similar.

 The oDesk experiment involved hiring approximately 1,000 workers to perform
 the same data-entry task.
 Workers were randomly assigned to the treatment or control group.
 Treated workers received detailed and objective feedback on their performance,
 whereas workers in the control group received equally objective but less
 detailed feedback.
 Treated workers had better future employment outcomes, such as higher wages
 and earnings, compared to workers in the controlled group who performed
 as well on the data-entry task but received coarser feedback.

 manipulated review volume at the margin.

e.g., by having at least one detailed review.
 At the same time, while a number of observational studies have used review
 volume as a predictor of sales, the question of experimentally measuring
 the marginal impact of a unit increase in review volume on demand and prices
 remains open, in part because there is no straightforward way to experimentally
 manipulate review volume in the field.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Review content 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Review text is inherently high-dimensional and typically not amenable to
 analysis by the same methods researchers use to study review valence and
 volume.
 Therefore, most analyses of review text rely on a pre-processing step that
 transforms text into a small number of variables that capture variation
 along dimensions of interest.
 These variables can subsequently be analyzed using standard econometric
 approaches.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a high level, two approaches have been employed in the literature to
 convert text into a small number of variables.
 First, researchers have used statistical approaches that rely on dimensionality
 reduction algorithms to map text onto low dimensional measures.
 Statistical approaches themselves vary in their sophistication from the
 application of simple formulas to compute metrics like readability to complex
 methods like topic modeling 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 that can extract latent structure and meaning from unstructured data.
 Another common approach to reduce the dimensitionality of text is the use
 of pre-built and validated dictionaries like LIWC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 that measure the incidence of psychometric attributes such as affect and
 emotion in text.

 provide a comprehensive review of the statistical approaches used to analyze
 text from reputation systems and social media.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These approaches allow the researcher to characterize existing text along
 different dimensions and these content characteristics can then be correlated
 with sales.
 The obstacles to obtaining causal estimates described earlier also apply
 to this setting and any analysis of existing text does not allow the researcher
 to conclude which characteristics of review content have a positive impact
 on demand.

, which are detected using LIWC) are positively associated with conversion
 rates.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second approach is grounded in consumer behavior theory and starts by
 forming a hypothesis regarding the effects of specific text constructs.
 These constructs are typically detected manually (
\emph on
e.g.
\emph default
, using human coders), or with simple pattern matching rules.
 Sometimes, researchers combine this technique with machine learning: after
 manually labeling a small set of reviews, a classifier is trained to predict
 the presence of specific text constucts in larger unlabelled review corpora.
 An advantage of using theory to form hypotheses is that one can design
 experiments to test these hypotheses leading to internally valid estimates.

Both approaches for studying the effects of review text are valuable.
 Statistical approaches can uncover patterns in text whose importance might
 not be evident a priori.
 At the same time, statistical approaches offer no direct connection to
 theory, and ex-post linking patterns uncovered by statistical methods to
 theoretical constructs can be difficult.
 Consumer behavior theory can help resolve these problems by guiding our
 search in the high-dimensional space of language patterns, and informing
 the design of experiments to estimate causal treatment effects

 Using a combination of TripAdvisor data, and lab experiments they show
 that mobile reviews are more persuasive, and thus have a larger impact
 on demand, than desktop reviews.
 The mechanism underlying this effect is that when consumers believe that
 reviewers who use a mobile app have to put in an extra effort in composing
 reviews (e.g., due to the physical limitations of small phone screens), and
 thus their reviews are more trustworthy than review submitted via a traditional
 desktop website.

Overall, the findings in the literature point towards substantial causal
 effects on the impact of ratings, review volume, and review text on demand.
 In addition to studying these features directly, a number of papers have
 examined moderators of the relationship between reviews and demand.
 A consistent theme that has emerged is that the relationship between reviews
 and demand (or prices) depends on consumers' prior information.
 Reviews are not the only information source available to consumers and
 thus they affect demand only to the extent that they provide new information.
 Below, we discuss how others sources of information available to consumers
 can moderate the impact of reviews on demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A brand is a traditional marketing mechanism that can be used to convey
 useful information about quality to consumers.
 The evidence in the literature suggests that even in the presence of reviews
 consumers continue to rely on brands to learn about product quality.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Luca_2016"

\end_inset

 finds that Yelp ratings do not impact the revenue of chain restaurants
 because there exists less uncertainty about their quality than independent
 restaurants.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 show that the impact of TripAdvisor ratings is much smaller for chain-affiliate
d hotels than it is for independently operated properties.
 At the same time, recent evidence suggests that the impact of brands is
 diminishing.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hollenbeck2016online"

\end_inset

 shows that between 2000 and 2015 the impact of branding on revenue declined
 by 50% due increased adoption of consumer reviews.
 Overall, the literature suggets that while consumers continue to rely on
 brands to learn about quality, review platforms can act as a substitute
 source of information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The amount of information available about a product typically increases
 over its life-cycle.
 Consumers may have significant uncertainty about a product the day it is
 released, but uncertainty can decline as more consumers adopt the product.
 Therefore, the timing of reviews with respect to the product life-cycle
 can moderate the impact of reviews on demand.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "babic2016effect"

\end_inset

 conduct a meta analysis of existing studies to show that early reviews
 are more important than recent reviews in driving the sales of new products.
 Because product quality remains relatively fixed, early reviews can resolve
 quality uncertainty, and subsequent reviews provide little additional informati
on to consumers.
 This is not the case for services.
 Service quality can vary significantly over time.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "babic2016effect"

\end_inset

 show recent reviews are the main driver of demand for services because
 they are provide more up to date information about service quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to providing information about quality, review platforms can
 help consumers discover new products and services that they were not aware
 of.
 This suggests, that prior consumer awareness can moderate the impact of
 reviews on demand.
 In a fascinating study, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "berger2010positive"

\end_inset

 show that negative reviews can have a positive impact on demand when they
 cause a sufficient increase in consumer awareness.
 For instance, compared to not being reviewed at all, a negative book review
 may increase the sales of a lesser-known author by driving awareness.
 By contrast, a negative review for a well-known author has a negative impact
 on sales, as expected.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the impact of reviews on demand is moderated by consumers' adoption
 of review platforms.
 As more consumers turn to review platforms to learn about products and
 services, and as review platforms accumulate more reviews, the influence
 of reviews on demand will also likely become stronger.
 Looking at impact of TripAdvisor on hotel demand over time, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "lewis2016welfare"

\end_inset

 find that the impact of a 1-star increase in a hotel's average rating went
 for zero to 25% between 2004 and 2014.

SS: my take on how to organize this paragraph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
1) move some of the content on identification strategy into section 2.3 above.
 What seems to fit here is our natural experiment and the influential re-tweet
 condition from Gong et al.
 The latter might actually be illegal in the US if the side payment is not
 declared (against truth in advertising standards), so it might be worth
 highlighting that.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
2) Section on impact / effect magnitude (this is already the case)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** a) within this section distinguish volume and text (it might also be
 worth drawing a parallel to reviews where we have valence/volume/text,
 here valence does not exists due to the nature of conversations; this is
 an important difference)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** b) it might be nice to also discuss why there is less research on this
 topic relative to reviews (data availability etc.?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** c) With regards to text we can talk about our findings regarding positive/neg
ative sentiment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** d) My take is that the Gong et al.
 and Petrova et al.
 studies really do not fit very well with the overall theme because they
 are not about WOM but firms' own tweets.
 I would drop that content.
 The one thing to retain might be the influential re-tweet aspect of Gong

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998773
 SY: I dropped Petrova et al.
 and keep Gong et al.'s discussion on retweets.
 I don't think they actually calibrate elasticities.
 The effect is large but it is not an elasticity.
 I note it in the writing.
 
\change_unchanged

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
** e) Is there really nothing else on conversations that is even close to
 causal? The one other set of papers that came to my mind are the movie
 ones like Gilchrist et al.
 (and there are a few others that are related).
 They do not have WOM data, but essentially think of the demand dynamics
 they find as driven by WOM.

\change_inserted 2105412453 1511998786
 I can only think Moretti (2011) fits.
 Several other papers, e.g., Knight and Schiff (2010), Cabral and Natividad
 (2016), and so on, mostly are about social learning where WOM don't necessarily
 happen.

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
4) Comments on Section 5.1 (how to influence WOM) are in that section.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now turn to a second important domain of online WOM, which is 
\shape italic
online conversations
\shape default
.
 This type of WOM involves consumers discussing topics on social media platforms
 such as Twitter or Facebook.
 Here we are particularly interested in online discussions pertaining to
 a product which may affect the product's demand.
 We lay out what is known about the impact of online conversations on demand
 following a similar structure as in the previous section on reviews.
 In particular, we discuss the impact of the volume as well as the content
 of online conversations.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

valence,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which was discussed in the context of reviews, is not a characteristic
 that can describe online conversations due to the absence of an aggregation
 mechanism such as the average ratings score.
 We then turn to a discussion of the moderators of WOM effects in the realm
 of online conversations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apart from the absence of a summary measure such as the average rating,
 there are at least two more important differences between conversations
 and reviews.
 First, online conversations have an interactive and social components.
 Reviews instead are posted by consumers after consuming a product and can
 serve to inform or persuade other users when they contemplate purchasing
 the same product.
 Hence reviews normally do not involve any direct interaction of consumers
 with each other.
 Second, conversations about products and brands are less directly tied
 to the timing of the product consumption by any of the involved consumers.
 Consumers might talk about a product after purchasing it or when contemplating
 a purchase.
 This conversation is observed by others and can influence their purchase
 behavior.
 Consumers might even be influenced to purchase a product in anticipation
 of being able to participate in conversations about the product after the
 purchase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We also note that the academic literature on online conversations is small,
 at least in terms of studies that use research designs aimed at uncovering
 causal effects.

The discussion below is therefore shorter than the discussion pertaining
 to reviews.
 At various points below we speculate about possible effects of online conversat
ions that have not been formally investigated yet.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Volume of Online Conversations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can the volume of online conversations affect sales? Based on the extant
 research, the answer is a qualified yes.
 However, this assessment of effect size is based on only two studies with
 fairly distinct research designs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset

 study the effect of customer microblogging on TV viewership, which is essential
ly the demand for TV shows.
 Due to a political scandal, the Chinese government temporarily shut down
 the microblogging platform Sina Weibo in 2012, which was the most important
 and popular social media website in China at the time.
 The block inevitably reduced the volume of online conversations pertaining
 to TV shows.
 An important feature of this block is that it was caused by the political
 scandal, such a reduction in online conversation volume is exogenous to
 the demand or the products themselves (TV shows).
 Relying on this exogenous shock, the authors show that the reduction of
 customer conversation volume does lead to lower consumption of TV shows.
 Accordingly, a higher volume of online conversations may increase the demand.
 But the effect size is at a fairly moderate level of 0.016.
 In words, if the volume of online conversations increases by 100%, the
 demand will increase by 1.6%.
 The magnitude of this effect is significantly lower than most previous
 studies.
 For example the meta-analysis of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "you_et_al_2010"

\end_inset

 documents a much larger average elasticity of online WOM of 0.2.
 However, many of the previous studies using observational data of online
 WOM and demand are often subject to the measurement challenges described
 in Section 
\change_deleted 2105412453 1512928078

, and are therefore likely to overstate the true effect size.

 also find online social media and WOM have a positive impact on TV viewership
 with a moderate effect size of 0.04.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a related paper, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 study the effect of microblogging on TV viewership.
 The authors execute a field experiment in China which is primarly focused
 on understanding the impact of a firm's tweets about its own TV show (i.e.
 these tweets do not orginate from private users and hence should not be
 understood as WOM).
 However, the paper also investigates one specific form of WOM, by having
 influential users retweet the companies' tweets for a random subset of
 TV shows.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We note that in the US, hiring influential users to promote a firm's products
 does not conform with FTC's truth-in-advertising standards (to conform
 with the standard, the re-tweet would have to indicate that the users was
 paid for the re-tweet).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 They find that an influential user's retweet boosts viewership (demand)
 by 33%.
 This effect is large in magnitude and (although not directly comparable)
 is contrary to the modest effect size found in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset

.
 However, the nature of the WOM is very different here.
 Most likely a re-tweet by an influential user will be more impactful than
 a tweet by the average consumer.
 We return to the influence of the sender's identity on WOM effectiveness
 when discussing moderators of conversational WOM below.

 Also, in the Gong et al.
 paper they find a very large effect, so this is not consistent with the

 was large too.
 SY: Do you think the qualification that

 We should report it here, seems dishonest not to.
 We can say impact magnitude is ambiguous.
 It is a bit of a special type of WOM though as it is an influential re-tweet.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
SY: See, http://jjzhang.scripts.mit.edu/docs/Gong_Zhang_Zhao_Jiang_2017.pdf,
 the effect size is not calculated in the elasticity sense.
 It is a binary treatment.
 The effect size for retweet is 33% (57% for informative).
 It is large, but as you also pointed out, I don't think we can compare
 it against the elasticity.

content of online conversations.

Similar to online reviews, the content of online conversation is also high-dimen

 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 find that WOM with positive sentiment enhance sales, and negative WOM reduce
 sales.
 For neutral conversations, the authors also note a positive effect, potentially
 because they increase the overall volume of conversations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512932952
However, analyzing sentiment in conversations faces the same identification
 challenge where plausibly exogenous variations in field data are rare.
 Accordingly, causal interpreations of the effect of sentiment on demand
 are often difficult.
 
\series bold
As an preliminary attempt,

LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset


\change_inserted 2105412453 1512933818
, the authors try to explore the variation in sentiment of conversations
 to study its impact on demand.
 In their context, the shut-down of the microblogging platform reduced the
 volume of all conversations, including both negative and positive ones.
 
\series bold
As a result, the data limit the authors' ability to explore the more preferable
 variation in sentiment over time within the same product (TV show) to show
 the impact on demand.
 Nevertheless
\series default
, there is considerable heterogeneity in the sentiment across products.
 Some products in general had more positive conversations, while others
 on average had more negative ones.
 
\series bold
Relying on such variation of sentiment across products the 
\series default
authors find that, for both shows with more negative conversations and those
 with more positive conversations, when the volume of conversations dropped
 due to the shut-down, they experienced lower demand.
 In other words, conversations with either negative or positive sentiment
 have the same directional effect on demand – less conversations reduce
 demand, more conversations increase demand.

\change_unchanged
 While this finding seems counter-intuitive, it is directly related to the
 mechanisms through which conversations may affect demand, which we will
 further elaborate below.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512933388
In particular, in the case of online conversations, consumption and conversation
s may be complement to each other.
 Namely when a consumer may participate in conversations about the product,
 it may enhance her enjoyment of the consumption.
 In this case, the act of conversation itself is affecting the consumption
 decision, but the sentiment of the conversation, positive or negative,
 is less relevant.
 Instead, when complementarity is the key channel, both types of sentiment
 may enhance demand, because they may simply be the indicator of a heated
 or even controversial debate among enthusiastic consumers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\change_inserted 2105412453 1512934177

\series bold
A second dimension of text is the informative content embedded in the conversati
ons.
 One potential channel for conversations affecting demand is by providing
 information about the product and hence affecting consumers' consumption
 decision.
 For example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "gong_et_al_2015"

\end_inset

 analyze the content of influential users' retweets.
 They find that when the retweets contain information about the TV shows
 such as the show time and channel, the impact on increasing viewership
 is larger than non-informative retweets.
 We note, however, the informative function of conversations may well depend
 on the credibility of content creator.
 For average consumers instead of influential ones, the information in their
 conversations may have less effect.
 In particular, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Seiler_et_al_2017"

\end_inset

, when the authors focus on the informative conversations before a show
 starts, they do not find any significant effect on the show's viewership.
 We will discuss such moderators of the effect next.

 and the timing of the conversation leads to a differential impact of conversati
ons on demand.
 We analyzed similar moderators, namely the uncertainty pertaining to the
 product in the context of reviews.
 The characteristics of the consumer engaged in the conversation is likely
 to be more important as consumers are likely to process the average rating
 and total number of reviews without analyzing the identities of the users
 which posted the reviews.
 Instead, the interactive nature of conversation makes it more likely that
 there is heterogeneity in how impactful specific participants in the conversati
on are.
 Finally, conversations can take place before or after a purchase and both
 types of conversations might influence consumers.

\begin_layout Standard
To organize the discussion of moderators in the context on online conversations,
 we first present a simple conceptual framework for the possible channels
 through which conversations can influence demand.
 We consider, three broad channels, namely informative effects, persuasion,
 and complementarity between product consumption and online conversations.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This taxonomy is based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_layout

\end_inset

 Informative effects can arise when online conversations among customers
 generate or disseminate product/brand information that resolves uncertainty
 about the product, enhances the awareness, or purely remind customers about
 the product.
 Persuasive effects may enhance customers' preference towards the productwithout
 delivering information.
 Lastly, complementarity between online conversations and product consumption
 may happen when customers derive a higher utility from the product consumption
 if they can participate in the online conversations with others who share
 the same interest in the product.
 For example, people may enjoy watching a sports event more when they participar
t in online discussions about the event with others.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because of the informative and persuasive effects of conversations, one
 potential moderator of conversations' impact on demand is consumers' uncertaint
y about the product's quality or value.
 Consider a product where consumers are rather uncertain about its quality.
 Informative online conversations can surely reduce the uncertainty and
 play a role in shaping consumption decisions.
 For example,

 evaluates how customers obtain information about the quality of movies
 from peers before making their decisions.
 Such quality information derived from conversations directly affects consequent
 sales of the product.
 
\change_inserted 2105412453 1512934776
In particular, the quality information has a strong effect for those movies
 for which people have little prior knowledge, and less effect on movies
 for which consumers have more information beforehand.
 
\change_unchanged
In this paper, however, we should note that the data do not have direct
 measurement of online conversations, and the conversations can happen both
 online and offline.

A second possible moderator is the trustworthiness of participants in the
 conversation.
 This is especially true if the main role of conversations is informative
 or persuasive.
 In the literature of network effect where an individual's decision depends
 on others' in her network, it is well documented that an influential consumer's
 decision may greatly impact those in her network (e.g.,

 We conjecture that such patterns may be applied to the current context
 as well, where the online posts by influentials can be crucial in affecting
 others' consumption.
 In

, for example, the authors show that when a firm's tweets were re-tweeted
 by influential users, it led to additional demand, which mainly came from
 the followers of those influentials.

A third moderator is the timing of the conversations.
 Both the exposure to conversations prior to a purchase as well as the ability
 to engage in conversations after the purchase can in principle affect demand.

 study the impact of conversations before or after consumption in the context
 of TV shows and find that the anticipation of the post-consumption conversation
s, has a positive impact on demand.
 Instead, conversations prior to the show airing do not impact viewership
 of the show.
 The authors interpret this findings as evidence forcomplementarity between
 conversations and product consumption (the third channel of influence described
 above), because informative or persuasive effects would both entail an
 impact of pre-show conversations on demand.

Research on the relationship between online conversations and demand is
 still relatively sparse, in comparison to the research on online reviews.
 Most of the studies so far focus on the magnitude of the effect size and
 potential mechanisms.
 Below, we want to propose a few potential moderators of the relationship.

\begin_layout Standard

The first potential moderator is consumers' uncertainty about the product's
 quality or value.
 Consider a product where consumers are rather uncertain about its quality.
 Per the discussion of the mechanisms above, information is a channel through
 which online conversations affect demand.
 As a result, informative online conversations can surely reduce the uncertainty
 and play a role in shaping consumption decisions.
 Furthermore, for some products, the uncertainty regarding quality or value
 cannot be resolved even after the consumption.
 Such products are termed as credence products.
 Automobile repairs, medical procedures, and dietary supplements are good
 examples of such products.
 There are also some products, whose values/quality are fairly subjective,
 for example, a TV show or a concert.
 In this case, because the values/quality are difficult to assess, both
 before and after the consumption, we suspect the complementarity channel
 may be especially important, where part of the utility is derived from
 the conversations, where the value/quality of the product becomes less
 critical.

In this study, the field experiments renders the results more convincing
 because it helps mitigating different potential biases.
 First, because of the random assignment of the treatment, it avoids confounding
 factors such as selection bias where firms or the platform specifically
 choose to target customers who previously show more interests in related
 conversations or products.
 Second, the experiments also uses identical messages which eliminate the
 heterogeneity often seen in tailored/curated content that may affect customers'
 responses.
